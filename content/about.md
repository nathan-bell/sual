“Shut Up & Listen” is a small group of music-loving individuals, based in Nelson, New Zealand, who get together on a regular basis to listen to music.

The group meets once a month, usually on a Tuesday, with each member taking turns to host. The session usually follows a musical theme, often totally disregarded or creatively interpreted, with each member invited to bring along several tracks of music to share.
