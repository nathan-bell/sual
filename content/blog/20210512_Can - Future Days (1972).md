### A remarkably restrained Damo Suzuki "sings" on what would be his final studio recording with this truly amazing German collective. (He went off and married a Jehovah witness apparently).

 When Malcolm Mooney left Can after recording their first album Monster Movie, Holger Czukay and Jaki Liebezeit encountered Suzuki busking in Munich, Germany, whilst the two were sitting outside at a street café. They invited him to join the group, and he did, performing with them that evening.

 Another totally genre fluid album from the early. 70s.
