### One of my most favourite recordings from the mid-80s, this Dutch group made all the right noises. It was electronic, it was goth, it was moody. It was an amalgam of the best bands I was listening to.

 The cover art, by [23 Envelope](https://nz.pinterest.com/aion1965/23-envelope-vaughan-oliver/?lp=true) (The 4AD Design Team) also lent itself to the mystery that was Xymox. Their following album, "Medusa" was even more inscrutable.

 Listening today, it may sound a bit dated, but fuck me, it still hits all of the right synapses. Those big dark Dutchies eh - who would have thought?
