### This is the first Luna release in quite some years. (well 13 years if you want to be more precise). 

 Kiwi Dean Wareham's droll deliver is just perfect as I prepare our "Hello Fresh" construction this evening. 

 It's an album of covers and some familiar tunes are re-rendered brilliantly. The Cure's "Fire In Cairo" and Bowies "Letter to Hermione" are two standouts for me.

 Funnily, I had just heard about Bowie's complete and utter fixation with Hermione Farthingale during the late 60's on a separate podcast earlier in the day.

 Life can be a bit spooky sometimes.
