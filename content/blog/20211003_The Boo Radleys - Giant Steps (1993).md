### Holy shit! What a FANTASTIC record! I didn't realise what an absolute stonker this is. 

 I listened to a great podcast this morning while hiking back from Tahunanui Beach, wife and dog in tow. (Actually, possibly me holding up the rear).

 It was an interview with Sice, lead singer of the mighty Boos, who have just released a new EP and forthcoming album in the new year. Their last album was in 1998. The new single "A Full Syringe And Memories Of You" just hits the ground running like they never left. That interview inspired me to go back and listen. Hey, thereâ€™s real, unloved treasures sitting on those shelves.
