### This triple album is part of the fan(tastic) re-release campaign undertaken by Stereolab over the last couple of years.

 It's hard to believe that this extras record (sides 5 & 6) contains mainly demos or tracks not used on main release albums. They are as good as anything the Labs have released. 

 From past experience with many other artists and bands it's quite often a case of never ever revisiting the over-bloated deluxe editions where most of the extra tracks are from the bottom of the barrel.

 This is certainly not the case here.
