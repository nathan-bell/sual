### You'll want to listen to this record sober. Just saying. 

 After returning from one of many end-of-year work dos, and putting this record on - my advice would be to play something a bit more conventional.

 There's no song structure to speak of, there's no melody to wrap around your ears and building familiarity is definitely a work in progress.

 It does sound fantastic but unless one is full-witted - it's not doing it the justice it deserves.
