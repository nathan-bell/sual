 Another brilliant collection, like yesterday's compilation, of extraordinary and ageless AOR music.   
  
Most of the time I like to feel the grime and hear the dirge. No chance of that this evening.   
  
This is well-(over)-produced, multi track, studio wizardry, brilliant composition and execution of the highest order. Up until the other day, I had nary any ELO in my collection. This changed with the purchase of this wonderful record.    
  
You want wife-friendly, sing-a-long, happy clappy music that is universal in it's reach, then this is it my friends.   
  
Tomorrow I'll get back to the un-listenable again. Back in my comfort zone.
