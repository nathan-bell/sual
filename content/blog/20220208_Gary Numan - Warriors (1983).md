### Shit, I've heard many worse records than this one. 

 Apart from a little bit too much sax and a funky dance vibe it's a salvable remnant from the Mr. Numan's spiral downwards that lasted for at least the next 10 years.

 This does hang over the cliff somewhat but things weren't helped by flagging popularity and refusal by ANY radio station on the planet to play his music.

 Luckily he survived into modern times and several recent records are some of my most played.
