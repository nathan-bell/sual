### I had coffee with a couple of work colleagues today and we got talking about music. (as you do)  
  
Among the conversation was mention of the band The Verlaines. Dunners very own iconic lo-fi guitar twangers. I suggested they may have been named after Tom Verlaine, the lead singer and guitarist of Television. I was wrong. They were actually named after Paul Verlaine the French symbolist poet.  
  
However, Tom Verlaine, previously Master Thomas Miller of Denville, New Jersey, also took the famous bard's surname. So I was sort of a bit right?!. 

 Any how, I made the proclaimation, there and then, that I would play this wonderful album tonight. And I did. Without a doubt, one of the greatest albums of the 70's.
