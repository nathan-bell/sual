### The last few records I've listened to have been a bit introspective and at times demanding.  This afternoon I've gone all Swedish Metal gone Prog, and uncut! And it's all rather majestic.  
  
Fucked if I know what they're singing about though?

 Lots of acoustic guitars, piano and strings and very pleasant, non-grunty vocals. Sweet.

 I picked up this newly minted double LP along with a few other gems for about $15.
