### Mew don't tend to stream stuff, so this demanded the purchase of their shiny new CD expertly tracked down on my recent trip to Wellington.

 On all previous records the tracks just seem to meld into each other without any obvious gap. It's really just one "song" ebbing and flowing across the entire performance.

 Their albums are also notorious slow growers that take quite a few listens to get the big payoff. I had a sneak listen of the entire album yesterday and was a little over/underwelmed. Tonight's listen is certainly advancing my engagement with this record and it is starting to liven up those magic synapses in my brain. There are now moments when you just go "wow!"

 Like all of their other records, they are a truly unique experience.

 There is simply no other band like Mew.
