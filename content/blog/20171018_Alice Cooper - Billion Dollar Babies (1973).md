### An astounding relic from my precocious multi-genre hopping pop/rock musical ingestion period of the 70's.

 I've just finished listening to the WTF popcast with a wonderful and frank interview with Alice Cooper. Despite being a born again Christian he's intelligent, articulate and plays golf on a single handicap. What's not to like?

 When you look at his musical output during this period he's more pop songwriter and performer than the angel of death. When your best mate is Bernie Taupin that's saying a lot.

 Alice, I'm not worthy!!
