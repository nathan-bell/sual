### I'm a new convert to James Mercer's witty, whimsical stories and quirky, off-centre soundtracks.

 My first real taste of The Shins was a different kettle of fish entirely. While his vocals on this rather lovely debut are vulnerable and intentionally meek(ish). The song that I heard first, "40 Mark Strasse", was from a decade later and characterised by a rather virtuoso performance. 

 This is far less polished. Lovely stuff thougn.
