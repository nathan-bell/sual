### It's December already! Off to Melbourne on Sunday for my daughter's wedding. I thought it more than apt to honour the Aussies with one of their more competent and revered musical eccentrics. 

 This record was one of my favourite records of 2015 and it still remains on higher than normal rotation.. While it deviates from Kevin Parker's introspective psychedelic purges, it's another top quality mindfuck. This time however, it's  pop sensibilities come to the fore. 

 See you back over the ditch in a couple of weeks.
