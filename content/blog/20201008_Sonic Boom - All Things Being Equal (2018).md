### This is a slightly bonkers, completely trippy, alien mantra by ex Spaceman 3 co-founder Pete Kemper aka Sonic Boom.   
  
Just a warning if you are thinking of ever listening to this. It's certainly not going to help you calm down or help repair any differences you may have with your neighbours.    
  
This will attack all of your senses and melt all of your expectations. It's like that dream you have when you are completely convinced at the time that it's real. Just try and convince me otherwise!
