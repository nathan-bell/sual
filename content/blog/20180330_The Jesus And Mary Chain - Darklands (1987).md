### A random letter choice this evening. (Thank you Son In Law Matthew).  
  
Technically, you could argue that "The Jesus And Mary Chain" starts with a "T" but for my filing purposes it's under "J".  
  
Anyway, it's a great, slightly mellower, less feedback infused, reduced wall-of-sound, more poppier affair than their classic "Psychocandy" debut and shows the quality of their songwriting beyond the usual cacophony.  
  
The purists of course implied they had "sold out" but they continued to polarise listeners.
