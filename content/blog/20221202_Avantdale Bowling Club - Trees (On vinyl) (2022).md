### [A re-listen to this fabulous record](http://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2022/10/9/avantdale-bowling-club-trees-2022) cements this as one of the very best releases of 2022.

 Nothing conveys New Zealand's societal pressures and bleak outlook, perceived or otherwise, better than Tom Scott.

 If that wasn't enough, this jazz-infused hip hop recording is nothing less than sensational.
