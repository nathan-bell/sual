### Oh by jingo this is good! The Man Who Sold The World Tony Visconti 2020 Remix!

 Ronno makes his first appearance following his thrown-in-the-deep-end BBC sessions of 1971.

 This is [Bowie's heaviest record](http://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2019/2/7/david-bowie-the-man-who-sold-the-world-1970) he ever recorded and this new remix just pushes things out even further.
