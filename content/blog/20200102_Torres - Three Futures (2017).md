### This record was a complete impulse buy whilst trawling the JB-Hifi bins in Wellington. I heard mention of Torres via the "Sound Opinions" podcast a while back where she was highly revered by Greg Kot.   
  
(BTW, it's a great podcast that showcases some great music that flies under the radar)  
  
Typical of my gamble with 4AD artists, it's a punt that certainly pays off. It's a riveting listen.   
There's a mix of electronics and abrasive guitars that reveal some exquisite tunes.Â    
  
"Here Come The Warm Jets" meets PJ Harvey. Fantastic!
