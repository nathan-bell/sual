### A bit of a "High Fidelity" moment last Friday evening as I strolled into The Family Jewels.

 Side two of this was playing on the shop and outside tannoys. My reaction was, "I need this record".

 OK the record only has two tracks but I often ask myself the question, if the song is in the groove - just keep the fucker going.

 Too often you get short changed. In this case it's just perfect.
