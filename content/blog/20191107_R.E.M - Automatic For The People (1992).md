### R.E.M has got a bad rap from our Shut Up and Listen group over recent years. I can't recall anyone playing an R.E.M song in the last decade or so.

 There's also been an unwritten law that also justifiably bans songs from Pearl Jam and The Dave Matthews Band. 

 This is controversial, but I'd be very happy to swap old cranky Canadian Neil out for R.E.M and clear the air. The fucker can't even play guitar!

 Anyway, this is a brilliant record that's now close to 30 years old and like a lot of their records, needs a re-listen.
