### Lovely late-80's album from Tokoroa-Born Australian citizen, Jennifer Patricia Morris.    
  
While it's got a definite 80's production vibe, all of songs stand up really well.    
(Luckily, it's not over-produced and benefits greatly from some recent remastering.)    
  
Honoured both in Australia and New Zealand, she's a bit of a legend both sides of the Tasman.   
  
I'm not opposed to paying $30 for a slab of Kiwi history. While her time fronting Crocodiles was more of my time, this is a great reminder of what a true artist and star Jenny Morris is.
