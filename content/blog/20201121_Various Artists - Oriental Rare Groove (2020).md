### Rare funky songs from the Arabic world. 

 This wonderful compilation is worth the price alone for Omar Khorshid's version of the late 1960's hit "Pop Corn" (\*)

 Never one to judge on face value, the funky, at times disco-flavoured innards of this record is wonderment and surprise in every groove.

 Just loving the diversity offered by my ever increasing range of brilliantly curated compilations.

 (\*) "Popcorn" was an early synth-pop instrumental, composed by Gershon Kingsley in 1969 and first appearing on his album Music to Moog By. It was recorded at the Audio Fidelity Records label in New York City. The title may refer to the short staccato or sharp "popping" sound used, or to pop music and its being "corny", i.e., kitschy.
