### I've never heard [Taylor Swift's 1989 album](http://www.allmusic.com/album/1989-mw0002726289).

 Ryan Adams covers it in it's entirety on this record - track-by-track. I'm not interested in comparisons however, as this stands alone. (Well I might actually after a few listens to this. Just out of curiosity?). The one track I have heard, along with most people on the planet, is "Shake It Off" and his re-interpretation of it is true genius.

 What other artist would have the arrogance to do a Taylor Swift cover album AND pull it off completely?Â
