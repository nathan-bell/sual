### Great to have some new Calexico back on the turntable. Actually to be truthful, this is my first Calexico album on vinyl.

 Just released a few days ago, this is a record that just oozes familiarity. Now that can be a negative trait for some musicians who just don't move on.

 In this case, Calexico do what what they do best - sound like Calexico. It's been quite a few years since they graced these shores.

 Myself, and current wife, Sarah, would just love to experience that spectacle again, Last time they played at the town hall in Wellington.

 It was a musical and spiritual feast.
