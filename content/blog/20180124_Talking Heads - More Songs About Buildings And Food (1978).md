### This is the Talking Heads record that got away. While familiar with some of the songs on subsequent live records or compilations, this is the first time I've actually had the pleasure of listening to the whole record.  
  
People have been hung for less I know - it's simply sacrilegious that I've missed this one. At least I had the decently to buy it fresh on vinyl rather than on shiny CD or worse, just streamed it.  
  
I must admit it sounds fantastic and a big jump in quality, production wise at the least, from their first "1977" record.Â   
  
Full of invention, it has obviously benefited by a certain Mr. Eno taking the reins. This just sounds so fresh and shockingly good!
