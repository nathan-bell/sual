### I heard a great podcast this morning when out for my morning walk. “Word Podcast” (aka “Word In Your Ear) a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED music nerd-fest, mentioned the fact that Jonathan Richmond sounds like no one else on the planet. 

 There’s also the very high likelihood that no one will ever sound like him either. And that is a great thing.

 Twee and inoffensive, this is another idiosyncratic masterwork from a truly unique, American musical free spirit.
