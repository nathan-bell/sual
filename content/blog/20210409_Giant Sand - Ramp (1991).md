### This raunchy grungy even, country-punk recording from the early 90s contains not one but two future Calexico members, Joey Burns and John Convertino.

 All I can say is this is a simply fantastic. The complete lack of taking itself seriously is just so refreshing AND most importantly, totally engaging from start to finish.
