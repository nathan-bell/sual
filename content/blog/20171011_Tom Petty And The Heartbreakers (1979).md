### 1976, I was 16 and entrall of punk and gritty rock'n'roll.

 My mate, Robert Hiscox and I discovered Tom Petty one idle afternoon. I remember it distinctly. The record playing continuously on a cheap, portable record player. It was an absolute bolt from the blue and still stands as one of my favourite "rock" moments.

 This magnificent follow up, while not as immediate, is another slab of brilliant songwriting. 

 While I haven't been a fan beyond those two records, I dedicate this to another American legend who has just left us.
