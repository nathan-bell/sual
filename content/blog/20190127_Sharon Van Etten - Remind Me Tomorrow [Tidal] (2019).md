### This record, just released a matter of days ago, has really caught my fancy. After hearing her interviewed and each track reviewed on a recent "All Songs Considered" podcast, it was top of my list to give a proper listen.

 This is apparently her first foray into electronica as opposed to guitar-driven songs and it has upset a few Van Etten purists. To these ears, however, it's such a fresh and engaging performance.   
  
While it's only January, this is right up there as an early contender for promotion into the premier league.
