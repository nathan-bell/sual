### This record is both epic in title and epic in the magnitude of its musical journey.

 It all starts off with a bit of a whimper but quickly imposes itself as the dense wall of sound engulfs everything. 

 You do need to be patient though, things unfold slowly. There is no immediate payoff or reward, if “mindfulness” was a record this would be it.

 There’s moments when nodding off to the mesmeric meandering is expected, but you’ll get bumped from your slumber as you are suffocated by its grandeur.

 Epic.

 No review will do it justice
