### More minor key madness from Mr. Toast. OK, it's the same song played 57 slightly different ways over 5 albums but I just love this guy. This is his latest.

 As I've said before, I don't know if I should be taking this seriously. There's some lucid moments during his comedic exploits on the brilliant TV series "Toast Of London" (Highly recommended by the way) but the majority of the time it's completely bonkers. Still not sure what he's on about here either but loving it all the same.
