### You’d think I’d be sick to death of Lana Del Rey. This is her 9th record since 2012’s “Born To Die”. Well surprise, surprise, I’m far from it.

 The calibre of guests and strength of songwriting on this one pushes it up amongst her very best. There’s some real surprises, especially “A&W”, one of her career highpoints.
