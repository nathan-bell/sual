### This recent compilation kicks off with a shimmering guitar, hefty with reverb, bereft of much else in the way of accompaniment and Ms. Sinatra's magnificent understated performance of "Bang Bang".

 It was simply made for Tarantino's "Kill Bill Vol.1" While this CD (Yes, you read right, the hard back book/CD combo was simply too much to resist), covers 1965 to 1976, it's the mid-60s tracks that shows her true class.

 Nine of the tracks are duets with Lee Hazelwood, which for me is the high mark of her work. The chemistry between them is palpable.
