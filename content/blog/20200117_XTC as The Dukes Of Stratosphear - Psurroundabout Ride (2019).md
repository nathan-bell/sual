### This astounding surround-sounding compilation is the cats pajamas for XTC completists.   
  
This mid-80’s recording found the Swindon band reinventing themselves while parodying the psychedelic 60’s and in the process bettering 95% of the bands of that time.   
  
All of the recordings are gathered here and tweaked for maximum listening experience.     
  
Every single one of the 19 songs on this record are oozing with magic (it’s probably the mushrooms!)
