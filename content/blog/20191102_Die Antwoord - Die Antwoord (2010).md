### Die Antwoord still goes down as one of my most gob smacking live music moments ever.

 Entering the big Boiler Room dance tent completely cold and expecting nothing, I encountered little pixie Yo Landi Vi$$er in full flight "ah ah ah, I am your butterfly - I need your protection" 

 10 feet tall Ninja responded accordingly. "I'm a fucking ninja". The MCs, the music, the moment, the crowd was all extraordinarily strange but it was totally enthralling. 

 As South Africans, it's only apt that I support them in the final of the Rugby World Cup this evening. But hey, I'm winning the sweepstake at work, and my only threat is a colleague picking South Africa to win for 10 points. I picked the All Blacks.

 Go the Poms! 

 It was all ok - I managed to keep in top spot AND see the Boks thrash the hapless Poms!
