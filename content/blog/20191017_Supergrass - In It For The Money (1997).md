### A fantastic second outing for this Oxfordian power trio. Barely out of nappies when they wrote this, Iâ€™m thinking to myself  "I bet a lot of musicians wish they wrote that one." In all honesty, this could be the perfect pop record. 

 Gaz Coombes, singer and main songwriter, has gone on to make several other superb records.   
Just a fantastic talent.
