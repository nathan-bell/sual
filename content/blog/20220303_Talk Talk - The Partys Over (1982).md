### I first encountered the great Mark Hollis and Talk Talk via their third release 1986's "The Colour Of Spring". 

 I kind of ignored the previous two records including this one, their 1982 debut. 

 Produced/encouraged at the time to jump on the New Romantic bandwagon, this is so much more engaging, hooky and lyrically smarter than either of the then sound-a-likes, Duran Duran's first two records.

 Talk Talk dramatically changed direction on each subsequent release over the next four albums. Each and every one of them are must haves in my collection.
