### This remarkable album of demos, half finished pieces and other in-studio recordings by cellist and studio magician Arthur Russell was released posthumously soon after his death in 1992.

 It is a stunning collection compiled from hundreds of tapes recorded during the early to mid 80’s. Avant guard, discordant meanderings, intimate noodling’s and dance hall bangers - it’s all here.
