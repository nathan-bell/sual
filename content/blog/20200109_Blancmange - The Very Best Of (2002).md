### A bit of a delve back into that strange transitional, and often awkward mid-eighties where you find these London knob twiddlers in their prime.   
  
If OMD and ABC had a baby - it might sound like this.  
  
With a catalogue of fantastic songs, they only made three records, what's the bet that most people would never have heard of this duo. Given the quality of songs and clever-Trevor lyrics they are certainly ripe for rediscovery.  
  
While it's one of the worst names in music history, and not easy to spell, it doesn't detract from their brilliance. It wears a bit thin towards the end but great to re-visit occasionally.
