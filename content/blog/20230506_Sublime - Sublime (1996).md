### I know absolutely nothing about Sublime. I always thought they were just another stoner, spliff-toting, skateboard pretenders. How wrong was I.

 My point of reference for listening to them this evening, was a solid recommendation by a subscribed YouTube, vinyl-only, audiophile channel.

 While I'm not playing this on vinyl tonight, but rather streaming it by Tidal, I can definitely see why it is most certainly vinyl-worthy.

 Just a great sounding, immediately hooky and smart record that needs a more permanent existence in my collection.
