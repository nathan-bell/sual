### I reached for a safety net this evening. Steven Wilson/Porcupine Tree is always an easy win to stimulate the synapses and trim back the auditory neurons back to normal.

 One can only take so much of Thee Oh Sees and John Dywer's unbelievable guitar histrionics before irreversibly melting the brain. (However, I suggest EVERYONE check out this band!!)

 Anyhow, you'll be pleased to know that I've come back down to earth - thankyou Steven.
