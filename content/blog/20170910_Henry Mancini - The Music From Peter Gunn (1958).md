### As cool as fuck and on icy blue vinyl to match.

 The first time I heard the Peter Gunn Theme was on "Peter Gunn" The Art Of Noise 12 inch single featuring Duane Eddy.Â This was during the mid-80's and was ultra-contemporary and club friendly then. Imagine this riff back in the late 50's?

 While the Peter Gunn tune is the stand out track the rest of the album is astonishingly entertaining and engaging. All for a mere $15 at TWH.
