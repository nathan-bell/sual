### In the early 80's, when I first encountered this recording, it was one of the supposed "Dinosaur" bands that just slipped this record in and made themselves right at home with new wave. (To be honest the original King Crimson was probably one of the reasons why punk had to happen!)

 Adrian Belew, one of my all time favourite guitar players, had played on recent Bowie and Talking Heads records so I had been aware of his genius. For me it was all about Mr. Belew on this record and it still is in my opinion. This and his solo record "Lone Rhino" are his best.

 Tony Levin also make his first appearance with his "Stick".
