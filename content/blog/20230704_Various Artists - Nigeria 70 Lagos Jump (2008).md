### Original Heavyweight Afrobeat, Highlife & Afro-Funk.

 This fantastic compilation, from Strut records, is a brilliant showcase of West African music from the 70's.

 Worth the price alone for the mighty "Afican Dialects" from Peter King. However, there's 13 other bangers - all of them gems.

 My den is bouncing around like Smithies' record shop this evening.
