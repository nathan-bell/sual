### I didn't quite get this record on first listen but subsequently it's now a thing of great beauty.   
  
This is despite sounding like it's been taped directly off a transitor radio. The songs are so good however, a little bit Pulp, a little bit Blur, but never as slick or contrived and that's what makes it such a engaging listen.   
  
As I said, it was never on my radar but it most definitely is now.
