### This is the reimagined version of the wonderful "Morning Of The Earth" original soundtrack which I raved about a couple of weeks ago. It really is like journeying back into the 70's.

 This, along with Blur's "21" box set, is a startling discovery. I'll be playing this and the original to death - it's that good!
