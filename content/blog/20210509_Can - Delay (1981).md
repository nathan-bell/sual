### These astounding recordings from 1968/1969 is empirical proof that these Germans were just so far ahead of the game. 

 The Stooges, who are often regarded as the granddaddy's of punk [didn't record their debut until 1969.](https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-stooges-mw0000195830)

 This fantastic record, which I knew nothing about prior to its recent release, is way way beyond all expectations.

 It is a beast of a record, raw and mesmeric.
