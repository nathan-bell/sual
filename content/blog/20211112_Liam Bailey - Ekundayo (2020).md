### Another deep dive into a rabbit hole for me of late as I take several forays into the world of Jamaican-influenced music.

 Rather than focusing on popular or mainstream reggae, I'm more appreciative of the edgy, dubby and experimental stuff. And there is plenty!

 This recent record from Nottingham born Liam Bailey, is a gentle step up into the contemporary side.

 Rich and diverse in style, it's a great place to start my journey.
