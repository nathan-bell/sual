### Nearly a decade prior to the release of one of my favourite SW moments, 2002's "In Absentia" where things started heading North towards metal, this gem is a previously neglected treasure trove of progressive rock meets psychedelia.   
  
I've not always gone digging into the early 1990's back catalogue but obviously there's still a wealth of wonderful recordings to trawl through. While I have heard a good portion of this material before, in its entirely it's a genuine surprise.
