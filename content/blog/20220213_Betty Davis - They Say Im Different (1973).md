### This is one of those records that would have really frightened the normals. Especially considering it was the early 70's.

 It's sleazy and confronting. Just think of a funky version of Wendy O Williams of the Plasmatics fame - both her stage performance and at times, her raunchy vocals. Itâ€™s completely in your face!

 That's why Betty Davis remained largely a cult figure.  She was just too wild a ride for most. Miles Davis, her husband for less than 12 months, just couldn't handle her.

 This is a great record, just don't let your neighbours here it.

 RIP Betty Davis who died on February 9th
