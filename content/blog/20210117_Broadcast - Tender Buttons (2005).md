### This is Broadcast stripped down both in sound and personnel. Originally from Birmingham,  Broadcast started out as a quintet for their first couple of records.

 They were often compared to Stereolab with their sample-heavy, analog synth-driven psychedelic sound. 

 On this record, their third, vocalist Trish Keenan and bassist James Cargill do all of the duties.

 They do make a jolly old racket for a duo but their stark approach can be quite challenging. 

 Sadly Trish Keenan died from complications of pneumonia in 2011.
