### The best god damned Albino Blues Guitarist ever born in Beaumont, Texas. Full stop!

 Another one of those revelatory experiences as a 13 year old when big Sis brings this bitch of a record home. I'd already been mesmerised by Townsend's guitar heroics on "The Who Live At Leeds".

 This reached a whole different level and was my introduction to proper(ish) blues and another awesome guitar player. Gallagher was just around the corner. Absolutely essential.
