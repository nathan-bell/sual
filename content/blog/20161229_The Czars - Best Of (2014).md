### Probably best known for the band that preceded singer John Grant's solo career, The Czars made a bunch of stunning records years before his fame.

 It's hard to find a more pure voice in all of contemporary music, and these songs, while recorded many years ahead of his solo work, are worthy of every recent acolade thrown his way.

 How John Grant didn't become famous on the strength of those 4 or 5 Czars albums, I'll never understand. Once you hear that voice the obsession begins.
