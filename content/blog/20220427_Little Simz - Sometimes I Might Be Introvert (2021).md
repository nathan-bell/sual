### This wonderful Hip Hop/R&B/Rap (whatever-you-call-it?) record from Islington born, British Ghanian, London lady, Simbiatu Ajikawo, was way up there on all of the "best of" 2021 lists.

 It's a sprawling epic that is diverse and uncompromising as is possible over 4 sides of vinyl. Quite the journey.
