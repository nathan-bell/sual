### **Live: Tuesday 27th September 2005 - The Olympia, Dublin**

 Not a moment or note was wasted during the Furry's majestic, life affirming set.Â   
Entering the stage on a fully band-laden space buggy and wearing stunning fibre optic suits they deliver one of the greatest musical and visual experiences I have ever witnessed.  
While never wanting things to end, the real highlight is actually their exit strategy during their 25 minute version of "The Man Don't Give A Fuck". Back on the cart, with a huge video backdrop, it was so perfect, there was simply no need for any contrived encores. The crowd left fully satiated and satisfied.

 As we left the theatre we walked past Rory Gallagher Corner on Grafton Street. My life felt complete!
