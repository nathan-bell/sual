### Is this the best sounding 5.1 DTS recording on the planet? This little chunk of plastic rendered by my player and theatre system/amplifier in glorious surround sound certainly warrants that tag.

 This must also be one of the most immersive and mesmerising bits of art/music I've ever experienced. It just never fails to enlighten and inspire. Those cleaver Japanese!
