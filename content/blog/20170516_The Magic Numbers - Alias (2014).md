### I'm off to Wellington for a few days so I immediately reached for The Phoenix Foundation.

 However, at the risk of being just too obvious,  I decided to go for something Wellingtonesque instead.

 I've never actually played this double vinyl record before, which I picked up for bugger all, and now, on the strength of a single listen, it has become an immediate favourite.

 I saw the Magic Numbers play at one of those Big Day Out excursions a few years back and remember they were pretty damn fine - in a Wellingtonesque sort of way. 

 They actually come from London and are made up of two sets of siblings.
