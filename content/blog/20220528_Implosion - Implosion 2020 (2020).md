### Obscure yet outstanding 80's Italian outfit that only ever released one solitary, self-titled album back in 1988.

 This FANTASTIC 2020 Record Store Day record contains 16 previously unreleased tracks from other recordings done between 1983 and 1989.

 It is exceptionally tasty stuff that combines space rock, prog, psychedelia and electronica. I really, really need that first record - this is just exceptional.

 So obscure, there's sod all on the interweb.
