### Track 1, "(Theme from) The Monkees" is one of my all time favourite childhood memories and still fills me with delight to this day.

 This FANTASTIC, fully analogue, remaster/repress by the legendary Kevin Gray is nothing short of sensational. It's packaging is equally magnificent and it's one of the quietest pressings I've ever heard. 

 While the newly fabricated group at the time of this recording did little in the way of playing any instruments, it's a fabulous rock'n'roll record that blows away many other albums coming out that year.

 Lets dedicate this record to Micky Dolenz as the only surviving Monkee.
