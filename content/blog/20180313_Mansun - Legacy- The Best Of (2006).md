### One of the most overlooked British bands ever, Mansun completely piss all over the best of them - especially the god-awful shite pushers, Oasis.Â   
  
These guys deserved the accolades but nobody really cared or obviously listened to the handful of records they made.

While "Attack Of The Grey Lantern", their debut of 1996, was a true masterpiece (for those that did take notice), this compilation (CD + DVD) is just about the perfect introduction to this wonderful band from Chester. 

I still can't believe the quality of these songs!!
