My life is now complete (well nearly, I just need to take delivery of the latest MASSIVE Bowie box which I also picked up for a steal - but I'll save that particular story for later).

Back live. All four volumes of this remarkable collection of Deutsche Elektronische Musik is now in my possession.

Volume 2, which has been impossible to find, had a recent one-off, albeit expensive limited repress. I just happened to whisper in someone's ear that I needed this!

In it's entirety, the four volumes make up 28 sides of vinyl and contain some of the most extraordinary, so-far-ahead-of-it's-time, German brilliance.

There's not getting away from it, everyone's copying these early adopters these days.
