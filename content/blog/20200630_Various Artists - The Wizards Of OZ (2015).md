### This FANTASTIC compilation is the 4th volume in the "A Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble (Exploding In Your Mind)" series compiled and mixed by The Amorphous Androgynous (aka The Future Sound Of London).   
  
Billed as an Antipodean Cosmic Space Music Odyssey from 1966 to the present it does a pretty good job of bringing some pretty wacko obscurities from Down Under out of hibernation.    
  
If I can't be in Australia for the birth of my 4th grand child then a least I can savor all of the current madness right here.
