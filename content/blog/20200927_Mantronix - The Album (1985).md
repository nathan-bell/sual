### Along with Cabaret Voltaire, who had taken a bit of a right turn mixing menacing electronic textures with funky dance rhythms in the early to mid 80's, I was totally hooked on the electronic/hip hop mashups of Mantronix.   
  
This really has stood the test of time and despite sounding a bit "of the time" it remains a killer record. 

 Full to the hilt with clever, never-out-of-place studio trickery this CD has never sounded so good. There's really is life still left in the little plastic disc.
