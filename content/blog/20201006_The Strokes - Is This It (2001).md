### It this It? I really think it is!   
  
While not just about the best debut in musical history, it's also one of it's greatest records.   
  
It's not original, it's sloppy, it's a tad too short, it's an absolute masterpiece.    
  
Along with The Stooges "Funhouse", Jonathan Richmond's "The Modern Lovers" and Television's "Marquee Moon", this record reaches the highest level of my esteem for American music.   
  
They could kind of do with the genius of this at the moment! Absolutely faultless.
