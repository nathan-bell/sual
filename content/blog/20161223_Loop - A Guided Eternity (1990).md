### Not the usual Friday evening fodder, but when one wants to purge this is as good as it gets.

 This just about drop kicks every musical genre known to man (and alien) out the window but still transcends all of it. It's like everything and nothing. 

 It's very difficult to concentrate on anything else when this baby is playing. No chance of multitasking then!
