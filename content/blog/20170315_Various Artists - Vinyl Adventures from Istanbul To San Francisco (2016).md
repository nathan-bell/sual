### I recently read the excellent chronicles of Tim Burgess's bin trawling around the globe, "Tim Book Two: Vinyl Adventures...") and picked up this lovely 2 LP to accompany it.

 Incidentally, this was one of the many albums that contributed to my well disguised hand luggage travelling back from London. My own vinyl adventures yielded well over 15 kg of well packaged vinyl.

 It's a real potpourri of tracks from the obscure to completely middle of the road. Like a great mix tape played for the first time, it's a real surprise. The book's great as well.
