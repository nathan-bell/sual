### Going through the top albums lists of the previous year is always a great way of letting others do the heavy lifting in one’s search for new music.

 Even better if it’s a less-than-mainstream and reliable list in the first place. This “filter” ensures that I’m not sifting through bollocky, run-of-the-mill, formulaic sounds bereft of creativity and adventure. 

 I need fuel to keep me moving forward. 

 Katie Kim is an Irish singer and multi-instrumentalist. Lush and cinematic, this album needs a few more listens but is a contender for greatness.
