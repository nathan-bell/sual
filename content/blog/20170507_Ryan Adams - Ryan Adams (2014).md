### I've just finished listening to a great interview between Ryan Adams and Marc Maron courtesy of [WTF podcast](http://www.wtfpod.com/).  
(I can't recommend this wonderful podcast highly enough - well worth exploring. Very much a platform for anti-fucked up USA)

 Anyway, back live, the interview was a very revealing and honest account of his upbringing, struggles with addictions (minus the stereotypical ranting) and approach to making music.

 I've bought a few RA discs on vinyl lately and this insightful account has definitely strengthened why I already like the guy.

 This recent, stripped bare record, is a return to basics and only highlights his fantastic song writing. I'd recommend this for any RA newby.
