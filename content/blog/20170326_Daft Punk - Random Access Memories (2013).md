### To be perfectly honest, I've never been a fan of Daft Punk. This changed this morning while reading my book "Vinyl Me, Please: 100 Albums You Need on Vinyl and Why".

 It got a wonderful write up and high recommendations.  [Also found [here](http://www.stuff.tv/features/39-essential-albums-audiophiles) following some more research].

 I'd seen the double vinyl LP sitting in the vinyl racks at TWH (for a pittance I might add) and never thought anything of it. 

 Newly purchased this very morning, along with some much needed cork trivets, I am now the proud owner. What I've heard so far - this is certainly living up to the hype. Loving it!!
