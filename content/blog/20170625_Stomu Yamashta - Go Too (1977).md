### God knows how I got into this in the late 70's?

 I know I was listening to Return To Forever and especially 1975's brilliant "Romantic Warrior" at the time. Al Di Meola is heavily featured on this record but playing more of the rock guitarist roll. And he kicks arse on several tracks. (His solo on "Mysteries Of Love" is astounding!)

 It's a brilliant album featuring some wonderful guests including Linda Lewis (brilliant vocals), Jess Roden, Klaus Schulze and Michael Shrieve. 

 This record completely hooked me in at the time of it's release and after punk kicked it into touch for a few decades, I finally tracked this down many years later.

 It's one of my favourite records of all time.
