### OK. I'm being right up front here. Give me actual, physical media over streaming any day.

 I reached for a randomly chosen CD this evening, put it in my repurposed Oppo Blu-ray transport and immersed myself in its warm, earthy, organic texture and sonic splendor.

 I really don't know what's happened, but God these CDs are sounding so good. This absolute gem from Portsmouth siblings, Jim and Alison Shaw et al, is a stunning, slightly ethereal/surreal experience.

 These random selections are coming up trumps every time.
