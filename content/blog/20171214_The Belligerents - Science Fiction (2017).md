### We stayed with our very good friends Maurice and Viv (affectionately known as "Mo & Vi") in Melbourne recently and immersed ourselves in Aussie culture. Mainly eating and drinking.  
  
There was also much trading of recent musical genres. Mo's prog affinities date back to the early 70's and 80's when I was more punk and new wave.  
  
Things have gone retro in many ways with this record by Bribane's The Belligerents. It's a real throwback to this era and caters for both genres - a sort of proggy-punk, but definitely sounding of that era.

 I was skeptical on first listen, but Maurice insisted I take it home and give it some time. I am now and absolutely loving it.  
  
Not too bad for a bunch of Aussies.
