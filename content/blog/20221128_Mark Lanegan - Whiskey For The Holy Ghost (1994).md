### You can feel the smoke and whiskey blend hit your face as the big gravelly voice of Mark Lanegan oozes out of the speakers. 

 I'm not trying to be a poet, that's just how it feels. These thirteen, mainly acoustic tracks, across four sides of vinyl, sound sensational. 

 This format really highlights the benefit of giving tracks space and letting them breath.

 Another fantastic record picked up for a pittance from Mr. Smithiesâ€™ Black Friday garage sale.
