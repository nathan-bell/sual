### They're a snobby bunch! Prog has always suffered badly when judged by the "mainstream" music press. You won't see a review of any Marillion record in Uncut, Q Magazine or Mojo.

 I bought a swag of Marillion vinyl at TWH when they were practically giving it away. To be honest, my expectations were pretty low.Â 

 On first listen, this record actually kicks some serious arse. While there's a certain Floydian pomposity to proceedings it's more song orientated than epic filler. I think it will reward greatly with subsequent plays. For now it's more than a pleasant surprise.
