### I’ve kept this one up my sleeve. 

 With lots of time to kill during the last couple of years of unpleasantness, Mr Cave and Mr Ellis have fabricated one of the most extraordinary and records I’ve had the recent pleasure of listening to.

 While up to the usual standard of Cave’s lyrical splendor and obliqueness, Warren Ellis is the master of musical arrangement and electronic treatments enhancing each of the eight tracks.
