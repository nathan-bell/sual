### It's very difficult to try and say anything about the genius of Mark Linkous. Talking about or trying to explain his music is mostly futile. The music just speaks for itself. 

 There's no casualty here - this demands concentrated listening. Like all of his records (Sparklehorse IS Mark Linkous) they are unworthy of my clumsy description.
