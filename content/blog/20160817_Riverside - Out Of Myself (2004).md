### I've followed this great Polish progressive metal band (for want of a better description) over the last decade. This is their debut record.

 They are obviously influenced by Pink Floyd and some of the more progressive English bands but have an edge like Tool and Porcupine Tree. However, they do just sound like Riverside.

 The beautiful and melodic guitar tones throughout the album are especially poignant - Piotr Grudzińsk, the guitar player, died in February this year.
