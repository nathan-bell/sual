### I looked high and low for this (you definitely won't find this on Amazon). I finally got a copy via The Book Depository, delivered for $11.64 US dollars.

 As with her two previous releases, one with Throwing Muses and another solo album, Kristin Hersh chooses to self-publish and distribute her writing and music. Â This package includes a beautifully produced hard back 64 page book of lyrics, essays and poems, along with two CDs.

 I'll give this a chance to nestle into my brain but loving that wonderful voice and there are already some big "wow" moments.

 I had the pleasure of seeing Throwing Muses (and Tanya Donelly!!!) live in Islington, London back in 2014. It was life affirming stuff. Definitely in my top 10 gigs of all time.
