### Iggy looks extremely happy on the cover of this record with a grin a mile wide. Why wouldn't he? He'd just been thrown a great big life line from David Bowie - who co-writ and recorded this and the preceeding "The Idiot".

 While "The Idiot" was my introduction to Iggy Pop, and it remains one of my great musical signposts, "Lust For Life" was a far more musical and ultimately enjoyable record. The single "Lust For Life" was also the star of the soundtrack from the film "Trainspotting".

 The band is exceptional, with Soupy's sons, Tony and Hunt Sales on rhythm section and Carlos Arlomar on guitar.
