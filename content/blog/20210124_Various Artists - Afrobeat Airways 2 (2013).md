### I was prompted to play this after a mention of the first volume from Analogue Africa yesterday on Radio NZ Music 101. The (frustratingly un-named) track that followed was a stunner. 

 Anyhow, this is volume 2 and is  a "return flight to Ghana 1974-1983". Itâ€™s an absolute treasure trove of fabulous and authentic Ghanaian funky blues.

 My only complaint is the pretty crap pressing on paper thin, wobbly vinyl. Not a problem for most of the music but horribly noisy between tracks. Luckily, I do have a lossless version on disc.
