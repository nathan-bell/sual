### A placebo is a substance that has no therapeutic effect or a measure designed merely to humour or placate someone.

 Placebo, the band, are more often than not treated similarly by the music press. Pitchfork.com absolutely hates them! AllMusic at their most enthusiastic gives them mediocre at best.

 While I deplore the whole conspiracy theory around "fake news" there is a lot of merit in NOT always listening to the music press and critics.  More time than not itâ€™s good to make up your own mind.

 This record, a firm, sentimental favourite, is the bastard offspring of Rush and Smashing Pumpkins.  The noisy trio played an absolutely stunning gig at the Town Hall in Auckland in 2003.
