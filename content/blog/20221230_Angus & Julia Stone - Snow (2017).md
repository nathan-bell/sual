### Brother Angus's stoner, melancholic alter ego, Dope Lemon was my introduction to half of this Aussie duo at least. 

 Adding sister Julia to the equation on 2014's self-titled "Angus & Julia Stone" pushed the mellow, chilled-out, easy going even further.

 This self-produced follow up is another great, feel-good album. Picked up for a couple of bucks while in Rotorua.
