### I don't often bring out old misery guts but given the bleakness of the situation nothing seems more apt.   
  
For me The Smiths still rank up there as one of the best bands of the 80's. They were in many ways my soundtrack during this period and also coincided with my move to Nelson in the mid eighties.   
  
I'll never forget playing "Meat Is Murder" on the morning of the [Heysel Stadium disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heysel_Stadium_disaster) which saw 39 fans killed during a match between Liverpool and Juventus. 

 Those were dark times and in many ways, music was up there ahead of food on my own Maslow's hierarchy. (Iâ€™d say it still is!)   
  
I'm sorry but some of these songs still make the hairs on my arms stand up and salute.
