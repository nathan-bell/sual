### This is even more brittle and unearthly than last night's delve into the (other)world of My Bloody Valentine. There really isn't any other music to compare it to.

 There are extraordinary and challenging moments throughout this record. Just don't expect structure or any type of musical convention. 

 Gobsmackingly different.
