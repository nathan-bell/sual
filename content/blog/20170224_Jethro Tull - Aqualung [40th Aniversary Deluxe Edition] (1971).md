### For god's sake how many copies of Aqualung does one need!

 When you come across a brand spanking 40th Edition Super Deluxe version (LP,2CD,DVD,Blu-Ray) for lest than $50 you grab it as quick as you can.  
I regretted missing out on this when it first came out - aside from costing a small fortune, it quickly became ungettable.Â Well blow me down!! Trawling the LP racks as I do every other Friday - I come across this stonker of a set.

 I'd pay the price for the blu-ray version alone. My life is now complete!
