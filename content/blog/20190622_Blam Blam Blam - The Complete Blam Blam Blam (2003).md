### I remember exactly the moment I bought this from Everyman Records. It was in 2003 and it was such a surprise to see this 20 year old relic compiled onto one collection.

 The Blams were massive for me. Quirky, ahead-of-their-time and spot on with their social commentary. Albeit Kiwicentric.

 It's now nearly 40 years since these little treasures first surfaced. "Don't Fight It Marsha..." remains for me their high watermark.
