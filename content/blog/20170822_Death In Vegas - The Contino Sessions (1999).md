### A strange old beast this one!? Smack in the middle of being a rock-noise-electronic record it borrows heavily from a myriad of in-congruent sources. You couldn't categorise this if it got up and bit you on the arse!

 It's an interesting and highly entertaining ride however and you feel a bit dirty having endured it. The first track, and it's a goodie, is called dirge. Very apt.

 A very animated and angry Iggy Pop, Primal Scream's Bobbie Gillespie and Jim Reid from The Jesus and Mary Chain are the real stars.Â
