### My Melbournian pal, Maurice, who I caught up with in person recently, has been raving about this record ad nauseam. To tone down his incessant admiration somewhat, I thought I'd better buy it on CD.

 (Just a footnote - don't give up your CDs anytime soon - they are becoming rarer to get hold of by the day and will one day be as hard to get as vinyl)

 I haven't really listened to The Strokes post "This Is It" (their sensational debut record) and this is a fantastic re-engagement. 

 It's a brooding, shimmering beast that will mature nicely over subsequent plays. Nice one Maurice!.
