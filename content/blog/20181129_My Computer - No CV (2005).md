### I was first attracted to My Computer by the mythical and magical debut release "Vulnerabilia" which I never managed to get a physical copy of in any format.

 I've had a cruddy mp3 version for a long time now but like all of my favourite music - you just want the real thing. 

 (incidently, I did manage to find this rare release on Tidal streaming service. I keep trying to remind/fool myself that streaming is just another form of media for transporting musical bits - physical CDs and Vinyl are also just another format). 

 This release was produced 3 years after that first record and is my favourite record that NOBODY knows about. 

 In many ways I don't want others to discover it - one can get quite possessive.
