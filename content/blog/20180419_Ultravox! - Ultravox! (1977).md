### Considering the date this was released, it was remarkably ahead of it's time. It must have sounded absolutely bonkers when I first heard it. It still does.  
  
It remains a funky, punky blend that despite it's age, seems ageless. Brian Eno produced and it  still sounds fantastic!  
  
Midge Ure eventually came along when John Foxx and others left after failing commercially after 3 albums (all brilliant by the way) and completely redirected the band into new romanticism. (yuck!)  
  
The hits came, including "Vienna", but Ultravox (without the bang!), quickly feel off of my radar.  
  
I have continued to follow the wonderful John Foxx ever since and his records have kept true to his original visions. He never sold out.

 This was and still is a very important record in my world.
