### It's Friday. It's literally the weeks end. Time to give your brain the heave ho and leave all pretensions at the front door. 

 This record is the epitome of full metal no-brainer thrash of the highest calibre. Hey let me know if there's a better kick off track on ANY record than "Holy Wars ... The Punishment Due" and I'll eat my neighbours hebe.

 The entire album is an astonishing riff festival that does not relent for it's entire duration. Not to be taken at all seriously but it's seriously good.
