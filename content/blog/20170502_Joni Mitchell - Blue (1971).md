### It's my first listen to one of those records, deemed by many, to be absolutely essential to own on vinyl. (Or in any media format for that matter!)

 It's a quiet evening, the wife's left me (for 5 days anyway) and the fires crackling on a cold, calm evening. It's a perfect opportunity for some introspection.Â 

 I'm not going to state anything overly definitive at this stage but it sounds remarkable. I'm not a lyrics man, preferring melody to melodrama, but this is just so sparse and raw - it begs to be listened to. Vinyl-worthy at least.
