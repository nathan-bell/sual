### I happened upon Anne Clark via the great 2018 documentary "I Will Walk Out In To Tomorrow".

 Prior to that I was aware of but not at all familiar with her music or her brilliance.

 Growing up in Croydon in the 1960s, she's a poet/lyricist reflecting on modern contemporary life and social hardship.

 She's not a singer in the truest sense but adopts more of a spoken word style. However, the electronic soundtrack suits her vitriolic style superbly. This is a great starting place to explore this highly underrated punk poet.
