### I needed a short, sharp burst of proper metal-infused, hard-edged rock this evening. Hopefully to fuck up the neighbours (who have a tendency to party into the wee hours) but unfortunately you need a really crap sound system like theirs to do the damage.

 Never mind this debut Tool EP satisfies my immediate needs first and formost. While less potent than their later stuff it still kicks hard. These are VERY angry men!!
