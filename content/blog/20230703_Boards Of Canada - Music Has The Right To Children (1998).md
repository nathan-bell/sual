### Not only frightening, frighteningly good.

 This debut album from Scottish duo, Michael Sandison and Marcus Eoin, would not be something I'd recommend to ease your morning commute with. 

 Maybe a sight seeing drive to Chenobyl. It conjures up visions of city decay, redundent tech, and the echoing flicker of dying electrics and the drip of acid. 

 While it's dark, found sounds, eerie melodies, big bottom end and relentless invention, makes this more than merely a masterpiece and more of a miracle.
