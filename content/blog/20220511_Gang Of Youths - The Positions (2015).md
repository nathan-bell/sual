### Half of the music I've been listening to has been from Australian artists. It's ranged from hoary old troopers to minimalist noodling and stoner folk.

 This Sydney-based outfit is a more straight forward "indie" sounding collective.

 There's a "The Waterboys" vide to the epic, crescendo-building songs throughout the album.  None of this however outstays itâ€™s welcome. Just a bit unremarkable at times.

 Seriously though, when you listen to anything on CD now, you lose so much of the soundstage that vinyl gives you. Maybe, I need a new CD player?
