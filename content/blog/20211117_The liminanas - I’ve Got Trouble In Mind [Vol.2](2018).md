### Another fabulous compilation from French couple, Marie and Lionel Liminana (with a bit of help from a myriad of others).This is their second collection in two years. 

 The fact that these tracks are rejects, leftovers and offcuts from other recording sessions is quite astounding. 

 There’s enough quality and embarrassment of riches for any lesser band to service a couple of great albums.
