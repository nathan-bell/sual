### Ok, let's do this then!

 Sometimes it's a process with Radiohead. Listening clinically, seeing what all the fuss is about and trying to makes some sense of it all. It can be a bit like taking medicine, some initial reluctance but invariably there's the desired outcome at the end.

 The biggest surprise however in this case, is that this new Radiohead album sounds like an old Radiohead album! While some of this material has been performed live for a few years it just sounds so fresh and relevant. There's also no adverse side affects.
