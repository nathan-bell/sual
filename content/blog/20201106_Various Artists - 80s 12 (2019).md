### Complete and utter 12" remix trash heaven this evening. I picked up this triple LP, 2019 compilation out of one of the bargain bins at JB-Hifi for $10. Take another 20% discount off (on all vinyl purchases that day) and you have a pretty cheap, can't lose slab of 24 songs.

 And you know what - I used to listen to a lot of 12" remixes back in the day and I have no complaints with this dowdy lot.

 Dead Or Alive kick things off with "You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)" and it all ends with Liza Minnelli and a remix of "Losing My Mind".

 A cheap thrill in any one's book.
