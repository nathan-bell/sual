### The recent death of Mark Hollis at just 64 years of age was a big shock. 

 His early songs from the first three Talk Talk records, while sounding clearly of their time in the mid-eighties, were the epitome of pop hook on continuous replay. I would have happily lived with just these records.

 It was his last couple of albums however, that rightfully garner all the accolades. Talk Talk's final two extraordinary records, "Spirit Of Eden" and "Laughing Stock", were unrecognisable in contrast to their earlier work.

 This was the brilliant man enforcing his singular artistic vision and completely shunning the music industry he hated.  These clearly demand some re-evaluation in light of the loss of this great man.
