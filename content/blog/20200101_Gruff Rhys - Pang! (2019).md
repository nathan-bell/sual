### Wowee, we've got a right one here! It's the perfect way to see in the new year.  
  
Bereft of any English, this collaboration with South African artist Muzi, is mostly sung in Welsh, with a bit of Zulu thrown in. As you would expect, there's a distinct feel of modern contemporary African music.  
  
It's a great mix of cultures and it works oh so well. It's another master class in songwriting from the head Super Furry Animal.
