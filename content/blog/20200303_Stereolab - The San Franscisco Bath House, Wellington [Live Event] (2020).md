 Having spent the last month totally immersed in everything Stereolab, I was hoping that this newly re-formed groop, down in this neck of the woods, would at least meet expectations.   
  
You don't get that many life-affirming moments in your life but rest-assured I can go ahead and tick another one of those rarest of boxes!   
  
Amazing, stunning and in the end - totally expected, I'd done my homework and enjoyed it all the more.     
  
Led by the amazing Laetitia Sadier, one minute they are the funkiest Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsborge impersonators playing Krautrock, the next they are The Velvet Underground and Sonic Youth doing lounge. Then just as effortlessly they are Pink Floyd's Meddle.   
  
Tim Gane, playing a beaten up old Fender Jaguar was sensational with a tone to die for - at times the dirtiest, grungiest beast you've ever heard.    
  
I could go on ad nauseum but it's one of those events you just can't explain adequately.
