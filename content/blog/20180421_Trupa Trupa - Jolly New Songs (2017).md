### OK I cheated with this one. I'm streaming this into my headphones via hi-res Tidal on my iPhone as I make my signature dish, chicken biryani rice for this evening's meal.   
  
Incidentally, my Biryani rice is especially nice with slightly cooked almonds and currents as a topping. It's a dichotomy of contrasts - ginger and spice vs sweet and nutty. A bit like this record really.  
  
It's a brilliant mix of all of my favourite musical genres which just makes it impossible to categorise. And why-oh-why would I want to?   
  
Anyways, this fantastic record has really become my latest ear candy. Trupa Trupa are from Poland.
