### I could listen to Jarvis Cocker recite the phone book (do we still get those?) or possibly of more practical application and in keeping with this record, "The Origin Of The Species"

 The second song "Must I Evolve" is a question I ask myself every day. Adulthood is just so over rated. Thank god Mr. Jarvis Cocker has never and will never grow up.

 His brain is just so fertile as it is. The electronic noodling compliments the rock out moments beautifully. Fantastic!
