### This is was one of my holy grail records to find on vinyl. Jason from "My Music Taupo", who by the way has one of the best record shops in all of Aotearoa, found it for me.

 Initially released in tiny numbers on vinyl when first released in 2003, this is the still ultra-hard-to-find, 2017 remastered version. So, I was thrilled when this finally arrived on my doorstep.

 Sarah's just come up stairs to tell me to turn it down a bit, it might upset the (new) neighbours. Job done. 

 The Yeah Yeah Yeahs are Karen O, Nick Zinner and Brian Chase.
