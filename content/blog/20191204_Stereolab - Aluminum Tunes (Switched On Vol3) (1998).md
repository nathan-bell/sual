### On Tuesday 3rd March 2020, my latest musical obsession, [Stereolab are playing at the San Franscisco Bath House](https://www.eventfinda.co.nz/2020/stereolab/wellington) in Wellington.

 As I may have alluded to previously, I've been gathering Stereolab's entire back catalogue on magnificent triple, clear-vinyl reissues.

 This is an early compilation of left-overs, singles, B-Sides and other curiosities. All of stunning quality.
