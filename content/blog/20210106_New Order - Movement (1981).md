### Just 12 months after the demise of Ian Curtis and Joy Division, New Order (initially "The People's New Order of Kampuchea") produced this transitional record to very mixed reviews. 

 Not helped (or possibly because of) Martin Hannett's totally unamicable falling out with the band, it's now revered as an incredibly important relic of the time. My favourite track from this time did not appear on this record but as a 12” single. “Everything’s Gone Green” 

 I was prompted to play this after listening to the brilliant podcast "Transmissions: The Definitive Story of Joy Division & New Order".
