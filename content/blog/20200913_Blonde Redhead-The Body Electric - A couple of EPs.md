 It's quite apparent within a few seconds how sonically pleasing the old 12" singles and EPs are.   
  
Some of the best sounding LPs are now getting pressed over several sides of vinyl as 45rmp.   
They just sound so good - but it does take a bit more vinyl.   
  
Back to these stunners. Blonde Redhead need no further introduction on my part. This single from 2010's "Penny Sparkle" is just fabulous.   
  
I have more distant memories of The Body Electric's "Pulsing" from 1982 but despite that it hasn't lost any of it's brilliance after all of those years.    
A good copy currently fetches $140 but there's no way I'd part with this.
