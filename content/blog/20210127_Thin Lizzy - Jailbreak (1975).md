### This is without question Thin Lizzy's high water mark.   
This is without question one of my top 10 favourite records of all time.

 Along with the twin guitars of Wishbone Ash's Ted Turner and Andy Powell, Lou Reed's Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter, Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham are two of the best dual guitar slingers in rock history.

 Just wrap your ears around "Warriors". Get your wah wah's out!! And dig that dual rhythm guitar that ends the track and side one! “Emerald” is just showing off!!

 After listening to the wonderful Fontaines D.C. last night, I slipped in a bit of fellow Dubliners Lizzy straight afterwards as a entrée to this evening's main course.

 Just brilliant!
