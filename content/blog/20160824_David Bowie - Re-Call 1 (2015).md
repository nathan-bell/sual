### On Vinyl

It's not a mandatory requirement to understand or even pretent to understand what a musically gifted genius is singing about. This is definitely the case here but I am still profoundly moved by most of Bowies 70's output. It's a relief to know he used "cut up" and reusable vocabulary to develop his lyrics. I used to think I was completely thick! It doesn't matter - his voice and his music is all I need.

This compilation of rare and unreleased material from the early 70's is part of the wonderful "5 Years" compilaton covering the years 1969-1973 on glorious vinyl.

I'm really looking forward to his next box - "Who Can I Be Now? (1974-1976)" which is released later in September.
