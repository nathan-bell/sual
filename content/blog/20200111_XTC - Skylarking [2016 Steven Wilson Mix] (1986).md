### This truly remarkable mid-80's release plays out like a Beatles record. Wall to wall "how can anybody write such amazing songs".  
  
There's quite a story around the making of this gem. Andy Partridge hated it, and Colin Moulding threatened to walk out of the recording sessions.   
  
Todd Rundgren who produced the record insisted on having full, post-recording control.   
  
Whatever he did, the result was certainly deemed to be their best record. This is a true masterpiece.
