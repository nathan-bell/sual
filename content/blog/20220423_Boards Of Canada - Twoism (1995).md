### BOCs first ever recording (limited to just 100 copies), was this generous 38 minute mini-album. Always extremely  difficult to find, it was finally repressed by Warp records in 2013 to appease the masses. Its great to have this as the starting point to delve into their subsequent output. Oddly pleasant, Pleasantly odd sums up this excellent introduction to two pioneering Scotsmen.

 Next stop is the highly revered “Music Has The Right To Children” - regarded by many as one of the most important electronic records in history.
