### Certainly "of it's time" this jazz-lite record still treats the ears. 

 I'm sure I didn't pay the $6.99 of the sticker price still attached to the disc but got it along with about 15 other DVD-Audio discs on one of my afternoon raids to the Red Shed. That was about 15 years ago.

 The DVD-Audio format is a brilliant, hi-res format that was quickly abandoned a number of years ago. If you've got the gear it sounds fantastic. They are also highly collectable.

 The cheapest I've seen this selling for is around $60. It's listed on Amazon for $337.56.

 It does get a bit "clean" at times and I'm now craving for some dirky licks from Old Kranky.
