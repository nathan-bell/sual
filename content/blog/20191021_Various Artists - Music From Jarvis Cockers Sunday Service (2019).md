### Talk about eclectic! This is just about the epitome of it.

 Jarvis Cocker the un-coolest/cool person on the planet, does a snapshot of seven years of his Sunday afternoon radio show.

 Convincingly thrust into my vinyl kitty, Smithies proclaimed that this was the missing link. He's fucking right you know. It's astoundingly good. 

 The King Singers doing "After The Gold Rush" and Cabaret Voltaire's "The Single" are both worth the price alone.
