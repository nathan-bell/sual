### "Acid Folk, Folk Rock, Freak Folk, Whatever". 

 This anniversary edition (currently streaming via Tidal) is another revelatory experience from yester year.

 While it's clear that Celia Humphris is a folky singer of the classic, conventional variety, you cant say that about the rest of the band who on many occasion veer way off course on a big psychedelic bender.

 There's some beautiful acoustic folk music throughout but it's the tangent that the musicians take that is so engrossing. Another great find.
