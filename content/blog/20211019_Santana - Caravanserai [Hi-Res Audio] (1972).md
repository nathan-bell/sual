### I remember hearing this for the first time, as a young nursing student, at a friend's place in Levin.

 He was a practitioner of Bahai Faith. (In this case the smell of incense wafting around the flat wasn't there to disguise the smell of other substances). 

 Aside from being a brilliant sounding and adventurous record, it also oozed spirituality.   
  
I've always held this record in highest of esteem. It continues.
