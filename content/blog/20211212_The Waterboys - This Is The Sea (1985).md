### Another great bit of vinyl that's found it's way back home. This 1985 Aussie pressing, which I'd given away in the early 00's and kindly returned, still sounds remarkably pristine.

 While possibly sounding a bit on the thin side compared to some of the big (digital) remasters of these earlier records, it's still a rich, rewarding listen. 

 Full of great songs, there's not a hint of filler on this. Nice!
