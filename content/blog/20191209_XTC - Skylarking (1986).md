### Is this the perfect pop record? A faultless masterpiece from Swindon's finest.

 Aside from the Beatles, I cannot think of another consistently brilliant band. Similarly like the Liverpudlians, they became a recording band and crafted their genius in the recording studio.

 Find one dud track in all of their catalogue and I'll eat Kettley's undies. This vinyl recording is immense.
