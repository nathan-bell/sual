### Same year and era as Tuesday's record, but an entirley different beast altogether. An Afro-infused ryhtmic treat.

 Think Paul Simon's Graceland but with autotune and a greater pop sensibility (and more hooks).

 A "wow who is this" inducing record if ever I heard one. While it's great to celebrate with others it's also a record you want to keep to yourself. Ruddy marvelous!
