### The Lips have always been very generous with their non-standard CD releases - if you can find them. 

 Most of their seminal records, including "The Soft Bulletin" "Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots" and "At War With The Mystics", are also available with bonus 5.1 multi-surround or hi-res recordings.

 I bought this record on release, played it once, was less than impressed and left any revisit until this very day.

 All I can say is "What the fuck was I thinking!!" While not chock full of potential radio-friendly hits, it's a wonderful, typically quirky bit of magic worthy of multiple re-listens.

 As I've always intended, give your less loved records another chance and you could be very pleasantly surprised.
