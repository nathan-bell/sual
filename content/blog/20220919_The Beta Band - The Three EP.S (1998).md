### A classic non-album from the Betas. This is a compilation of early EP's. Nary a missed beat from these Scotsmen.

 Brilliant, dreamy strum-along, sing-along anthems that traverse folk, rock and indie. They were only around for a short time but certainly left their mark.

 Dave Mason continues to flourish as a solo artist.
