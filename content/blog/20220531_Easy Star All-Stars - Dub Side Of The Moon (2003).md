### Some times old rock dinosaurs just need to lighten up a bit. Roger Waters especially continues to be an old misery guts and wallows in self-pity.

 Nearly a decade ago these New York Reggae dub de/re-constructionists totally revamped DSOTM into a proper dubby masterpiece.

 It's a seriously good remake that maintains the dignity and respect this record warrants while stripping it of any pretentiousness.

 They also did it to Radiohead's "OK Computer" (Radiodread)
