### I'm reading "Facing The Other Way: The Story of 4AD" at the moment and reliving memories of the truly eclectic music I was exposed to during the post-punk 80s.

 I was drawn to the [4AD stable of artists](http://4ad.com/artists) as they truly challenged the conventional. The packaging was always remarkably original and stylish as well.

 This month I'm going back through my 4AD catalogue and for my listening sessions, playing nothing else.

 This record is the first of three TMC albums and has probably the series best known tracks "Song To The Siren" by Elizabeth Fraser. It's goose bump material.Â It can be a creepy, disconcerting listen epitomising some of the Gothic ethos at the time. Dead Can Dance's "Dreams Made Flesh" is particularly disturbing.

 There's just nothing quite like it these days but 4AD is still going strong. Aldous Harding is on that label and her second album "Party" fits like a glove.
