### Everything about Mr. Prolific here, and even more so since the demise of former band Smog, is the richness of his ever maturing voice, along with the power of his story telling. 

 You could also add the amazing musicianship and fabulous dynamics of his soundtrack. Not much to complain about then.

 While close to perfection, his records are best savoured when your ears are open to such transcendence. Don't waste your time unless you are fully immersed.

 This is an absolute stunner! Not one moment is wasted.

 His concert with Joanna Newsom in Wellington was one of life's enduring highlights.
