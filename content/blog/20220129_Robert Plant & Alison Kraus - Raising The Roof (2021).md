### Another record I’ve been holding off listening to. The moment needed to be just right.

 Saturday afternoon and I’m not feeling so sharp, so on the turntable this wee gem goes. My current wife Sarah is out at our favourite watering hole, and our regular Saturday afternoon jaunt.

 I’m sure great music has instant healing properties. I end up playing it twice - it is just beautiful.

 Just as the last couple of tracks are playing my good wife returns home holding a vinyl record. She's snuck in to see Mr. Smithies. 

 Now, this isn't any old record, it's one of those rather expensive "must haves" that just happens to be on my shopping list. The very wonderful Arthur Russell's "Another Thought".

 It was just the miracle cure I needed.
