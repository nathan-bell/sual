### In my persute of "making do" with what I've already got, I've even gone back to wired headphones via a little DragonFly DAC. This is rigged to my iPhone when I'm out on walkabout with the pooch.

 My old-school meets new-school approach to consuming music, is really paying dividends. This just sounds extraordinary through my cans.

 This new release from Melbournian Laura Jean is fabulous. I've given it a couple of listens today and it's a real grower.
