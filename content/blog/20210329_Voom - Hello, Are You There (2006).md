### This re-release from 2006 is an astonishing hidden-from-me NZ gem that in my universe-wide musical horizon flew completely under my exceptionally big reflecting telescope.

 This is as close to a Grandaddy record as one could get. This is going on repeat repeat. 

 I urge you to get yourself a copy.
