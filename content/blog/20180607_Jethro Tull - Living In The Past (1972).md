### More from those seminal years then. Thank god punk and new wave eventually came along to rescue one from the dinosaurs that prevailed but there really was no other period for rock like the early to mid 70s.

 It’s always great to go back in time as long as one doesn’t dwell too long and get comfortable.

 This Tull record, which I do hold in high regard, mixes jazz, folk, hard rock and classical over four sides of vinyl.  
  
Side three’s live recording from Carnegie Hall showcases the classically trained John Evans brilliantly. Aqualung was just around the corner!
