### Recorded live at the Pyramid and Meow Clubs in Wellington during December 2014.

 Channeling ancient future funk from the IS! Warping spatioelastoplasticity with sound! 

 The Spheres use homemade instruments like the biscuit tin guitar, electric bass carillon and sexomouse marimba to create their cosmic dancing sound. 

 Expect the unexpected with this great record of right-outer-here cosmic blues.
