### Another random selection from my "Lucky Strike At The Red Cross" collection.

 This album on the Sub Pop label, turned out to be a side project by Fleet Foxes members Christian Wargo and Casey Wescott.

 And what a very pleasant surprise it is indeed. It has a similar feel to the wonderful Lord Huron but also hints at some of Fleet Foxes sumptuous harmonies.

 That's $2 well spent so far.
