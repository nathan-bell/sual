### There's a Steven Wilson gig in Auckland to attend in several weeks time so I'm getting more acquainted with his most recent stuff.

 It's not really up there with my favourite stuff of his, but I can appreciate the merits of repeated listens. Itâ€™s still of the highest quality and appeal, just not ingrained as of yet.

 It does sound MF good on 45 rpm vinyl!
