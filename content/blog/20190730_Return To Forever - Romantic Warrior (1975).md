### I finally got this big MF of an album on vinyl!   
  
This is one of those watershed records, along with Jeff Beck's "Wired" and Santana's "Caravanserai/Moonflower", that helped to define and steer my musical encounters for the next couple of decades.

 While Punk and New Wave were at the fore during the late 70's and early 80's, I still pined for the proper musicianship and virtuosity of the guitar dude. In this case it was a very young Al Di Meola who shined among three other impeccable musicians at the top of their game - Stanley Clarke, Lenny White and the great Chick Corea.   
  
Beyond pretentious, it still sparks the synapses.
