### For some light summer reading, I'm currently plowing through Jeff Apter's biography of The Bee Gees, "Tragedy: The Sad Ballad of The Gibb Brothers". 

 This album, their international debut, is chock full of 60's pop and psychedelia, and sits (un)comfortably alongside those other hit makers, The Beatles and The Hollies.

 While clearly contrived to sound of the time, there was a string of great songs and big hits over several subsequent albums. This for me is their best version of themselves.
