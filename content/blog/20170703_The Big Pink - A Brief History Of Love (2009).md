### "The Big Dirge" more like it! But amidst all of the suffocation are some really good songs that hark back to the sound I was engrossed with during the late 80's and 90's.

 In certain places it's a racket that many would find overwhelming. If you hang around long enough and persevere however, there's some real gems. "Dominos" the 3rd track in for instance, sounds anthemic and uplifting.

 OK, it's nothing that the The Verve, Chapterhouse and The Catherine Wheel haven't already ticked off but it's still rather engaging.
