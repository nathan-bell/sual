### I'm a bit disappointed with this new "special edition" release. The music is brilliant, the packaging and blue splatter vinyl exceptional.

 However, when presentation is at the expense of owning a nice, quiet record, I feel a bit cheated.

 Sides 3 and 4 sound acceptable but sides 1 and 2 are truly unplayable.

 OK, I'll keep the album, and probably play the high resolution "WAV" download that's also available with this release.

 That's one nail in the coffin of vinyl vs digital.
