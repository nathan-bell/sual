### This stonkingly great 6 Track, mini-album comes from the remnants of the incredible band Low.

 Led by Alan Sparhawk, and joined by his son Cyrus, this music could not be any further away from Low's remarkable musical legacy.

 The incredible telepathy between himself and now deceased, Mimi Parker, could never, ever be replicated.

 At the moment this is only available on streaming services.
