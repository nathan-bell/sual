### Another fabulous compilation from Soul Jazz Records. (Along with ACE records, Soul Jazz does the best compilations). 

 This collection of largely unknown knob twiddlers and music anarchists truly reflect the vide that existed in the late 70's and early 80's.

 It's as DIY as you can get but like those "who gives a flying fuck" times many decades earlier, it just sounds so incredibly fresh and exciting.
