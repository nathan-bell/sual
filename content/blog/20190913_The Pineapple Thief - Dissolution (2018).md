### This big proggy rocky thing is a real treat. Bought for just $12 in some bargain bin in a Melbourne mall, it's a superb album that rewards you more on each subsequent listen.

 Fortunately, I've got a few other records by the Pineapples and knew at the time what a great find it was. I also forgot to mention that its not just some cheap, flimsy CD in a cracked CD case, with a frustratingly smudgy, non-removable slicker, it's a brand spanking new, Hi-Res Blu-Ray Audio disc.

 Not only that, there's the magnificence of the full version of the record, as well as another acoustic version of the whole record. Both versions sound fantastic.
