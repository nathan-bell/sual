### I'm listening to part one of Big Boi and Andre 3000's split-duties-opus "Speakerboxxx/The Love Below" this evening - and loving every minute of it.

 Part one, is Big Boi's "Speakerboxx". This is nothing less than riveting over its four sides of vinyl. (The whole thing is on 8 sides of vinyl and over 2 hours and 14 minutes!!)

 While predominantly hip hop, there really is no genre that is spared. It's just brilliant.
