### Got this big chunk of glorious translucent green vinyl via courier yesterday from Real Groovy in Auckland.Â   
  
I've been streaming this beauty for the last couple of months and simply can't get enough of it. It's the sort of record that saturates your musical synapses. There's a few truly astounding tracks that just makes it impossible to maintain such a high benchmark throughout. The other tracks I would consider merely "brilliant" by comparison.  
  
This would be my pick for best record of 2017. I simply had to have this on vinyl and not restrained by digital compression.
