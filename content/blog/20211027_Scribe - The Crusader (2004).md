### This record (especially the track "Not Many") was a bit of a soundtrack for my teenagers. It also resonated strongly with me at the time.

 I was talking with my record broker, Smithies, this afternoon who was just writing up a recent and confronting interview with Scribe.

 Addicted to Meth and Alcohol, Scribe eventually fell into a violent and drug fueled existence.   
I was somewhat committed to playing this record this evening.

 Along with Pauly Fuemana's OMC, Scribe is an iconic Kiwi record of the time. Still sounds great BTW.
