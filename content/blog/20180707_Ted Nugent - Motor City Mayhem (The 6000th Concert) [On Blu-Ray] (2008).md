### Well Wang Dang Sweet Poontang! You may wonder why on earth would I be watching this red neck, right wing, NRA high priest, racoon tailed, misogynist geriatric play to an audience of mostly chubby fellow white trash devotees.  
  
Coz he's a mean mother fucker guitar player that's why.  
  
A lot of his banter is nauseating and his screaming "Freedom" and promoting "blowing arseholes heads off" is hardly comforting but hey don't let that get in the way.

 I happened to encounter him recently while listening to a Joe Rogen podcast. What was especially worrying to me was that a lot of what he was talking about made complete sense.  
While he's a complete cunt and so far up his own arse, his beliefs about the food industry and the state of the world were somewhat revealing.  
  
I did have several of his early solo records, "Ted Nugent", "Free For All" and "Cat Scratch Fever" in my collection in the mid-70's. Back then it was always just about the music.

 By the way, less than $2 was spent on acquiring this Blu-ray disc and no animals were harmed in it's purchase.
