### Everyone should have at least one copy of this on stand by at all times. If you need some background music, it works. 

 If you need some more in-your-face jazz-infused electronica, it works.   
  
If Nana is staying the night and there's a distinct lull in proceedings you could play this without offence.

 This could possibly be one of the safest records you could ever play.   
  
It's also a fabulous listen in any circumstance.   
  
Purchased on newly minted, remastered vinyl. Anyone want that spare copy on CD?
