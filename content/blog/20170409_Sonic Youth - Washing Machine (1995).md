### **Live: Wednesday 10th January 1996 - Town Hall, Wellington Live: Saturday 26th June 2004 - St.James Theatre, Auckland**

 "The Diamond Sea" played at Wellington Town Hall in 1996 could possibly be my single best live musical "moment". Nothing else was important or relevant in the world for that 20 minutes. The only thing that was mildly annoying about it was a couple of fuckers talking throughout.

 It didn't really matter though, the genius of Thurston Moore and Lee Renaldo's other worldly guitar antics quickly extinguished that distraction and erased the irrelevant.

 When they played with J.Mascis in Auckland the following decade, supporting the recently released "Sonic Nurse", I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. J.Mascis was absolutely astounding. The Youth's played another blinder.

 At that Auckland gig Kim Gordon was also the bees knees!
