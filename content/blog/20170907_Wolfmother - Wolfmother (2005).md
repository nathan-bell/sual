### I was going to reach for my freshly minted copy of The Jimi Hendrix Experience's "Electric Ladyland" but my tired demeanour and waning concentration could never do it the justice it clearly deserves. I'll save that for a more sensible day.

 I rolled the old randomiser and went for these Aussie 70's reprobates.  If members of Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and The White Stripes had Aussie babies (quite possible if you ask me!) that became accomplished Aussie musicians (highly unlikely if you ask me!) they'd deliver something like this beast. It's a shit load of fun and fury - just what I needed to wake me up.

 These dudes did an absolute stonker of a show at The Big Day Out in 2006.
