### I swear Jason Lytle played a busker's set at the Saturday Nelson market a few months back. My son Peter can confirm it.  It wasn't him, but the fantastic Lytle(esque) vocals could very well have belonged to the Grandaddy main man. We were both riveted to the spot by this magnificent auditory spectacle.  Unfortunately, we didn't catch his name.

 I bought a copy of this Jason Lytle solo album (as well as his first record) for the measly sum of $22 on double vinyl + CD from "Polyester Records". 

 Unexpectedly Brilliant!
