### After last night's fabulous, Afro-centric jazz monster, something equally rich and musical is called for.

 This drum'n'bass classic from England's then king of Jungle, has moments of bliss. However, not being a big fan of the genre means I don't really have the patience for long, meandering whig outs.

 Saying that though, there are some stunning R&B tracks, especially "State Of Mind" as well as some fine fret work by Pat Metheny on "Sea of Tears".

 This is ok on the right occasion and possibly sitting in a wee gladed gully at Canann Downs, think 1998's "The Gathering", but not great mid-week fodder up in the den.
