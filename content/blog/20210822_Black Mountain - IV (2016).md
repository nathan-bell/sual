### Another terrific record, their forth, in a faultless catalogue of neo-70's rock/prog.

 While they certainly know how to jam, they never overstay their welcome.

 "Space To Bakersfield" is a 10 minute classic guitar wig out. When I first heard this track on headphones (on one of my long walks) I stopped breathing.
