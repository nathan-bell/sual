### There's some truly gut-busting, funky minimalism going on here!   
  
It's dance-punk if you really want to label it.   
  
The Scroggin sisters, which hail from The Bronx, which now include a new generation of daughters playing in the group, have been around since the late 70's.   
  
They have been sampled to death over the years and pop up on many more successful artist's records. They even wrote a song about it on 1992's 12" EP "Sample Credits Don't Pay Our Bills"   
  
Not knowing what to expect, this is a VERY pleasant surprise indeed.
