### The Tree stripped bare. This is an instore, mainly acoustic set, with just Steven Wilson and John Wesley accompanying him on guitar and backing vocals.  
  
It's always a good test of song writing when songs, obviously geared towards the full band treatment, translate so well when performed live and unplugged.  
  
While it would frustrate most metal heads and progressive purists, this for me works and absolute treat.

 Not recommended for the casual listener, but for a SW completist it's essential.
