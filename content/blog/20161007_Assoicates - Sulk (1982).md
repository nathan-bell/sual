### Billie Mackenzie had one of the most distinctive and extraordinary voices in pop/rock history. He eventually met a tragic, self-inflicted demise despite being an exceptional but underappreciated talent.

 While this is not all pleasant listening, and this is certainly intentional, it's an unnerving and exceptional listen all the same. It's often a complete mess and would have most people hitting the eject button.

 Those with any taste and patience will see this as a crazy but genius ridden relic of the 80's. Incomparable.
