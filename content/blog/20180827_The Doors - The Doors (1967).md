### I was never a great Doors fan. To be fair I never really listened much to any American music until ... gulp.... and quite possibly ... another gulp... the fucking Eagles and Doobie Brothers.  
  
OK there was some jazz fusion stuff and some Lou Reed/Velvet Underground but Talking Heads, The Modern Lovers and The Stooges came along a lot later in the piece. I definitely missed getting excited about Buffalo Springfield, CSNY, Jefferson Airplane or The Grateful Dead.

 I tell you what though, when things clicked with Sonic Youth, Grandaddy and Pavement,Â  I completely lost my Anglo centricity.  
  
Imagine missing all of those amazing American dramas if all you watched was Coro and The Chase.

 This Doors record is fabulous on vinyl and in glorious mono.
