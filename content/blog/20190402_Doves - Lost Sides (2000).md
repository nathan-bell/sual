### Compilation of B-sides and other non-album tracks that makes up part of the Doves "Box Set".  Picked up for a pittance ($2.97) at the Warehouse recently.

 There's some great tracks amongst some merely good ones. The only thing missing is the coherence you get from their regular releases.

 This multi-CD,[re-purchase makes complete sense](http://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2019/3/17/doves-the-last-broadcast-2002)  as it gives me several extra centimeters of wriggle room on my CD shelf. The old clunky plastic cases are heading North.

 My quest for Döstädning continues
