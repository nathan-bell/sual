### Gone are the days of trucking over to Wellington and coming back over-endowed with swags of shiny new CDs and DVDs. (It doesn't stop me bringing back over stuffed bags of vinyl however!).  
  
Just about the only digital media I would buy these days is a significant release that greatly improves on the original or completely trumps any analogue version. This is just the case with this masterpiece.  
  
One of five releases worthy of surround sound remasters from XTC's catalogue,  this is another example of the brilliance of XTC and the magic of surround/hi-res mastering genius Steven Wilson.   
  
If I was picking desert island discs, I could not exclude less that 4 or 5 XTC releases.
