### I was completely stopped in my tracks early one morning last week by a wonderful bit of British Folk Rock playing on the radio. 

 It’s quite common to hear some brilliant music playing on the pre-Morning Report show on Radio NZ. It’s a great time to be exposed to some truly tasteful and eclectic tunes.

 The song that was playing this particular morning was “Storm Song” by the Smoke Fairies. Straight into Tidal to search out the record. 

 This is my first listen and I must say, I’m mightily impressed. This and their 3 subsequent records will get a good work out.
