### Another stonking Tull release that got panned at the time. A first time listen for me but a rockier effort following their folk period "Songs From The Wood", "Heavy Horses" and "Storm Watch".

 This is the Ian Anderson show with only one of the original Tull members left, the incomparable and brilliant Martin Barre.

 As with the previous "new" Tull experience a week earlier, these deluxe editions are second to none. In this case 3 CDs 3 DVDs and 100 page book all wrapped up in impeccable hardback packaging.
