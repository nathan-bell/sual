### When we happen to have a visiting contingent of guests, related or otherwise, I'm always conscious of playing music in the lounge that does not challenge.

 What I consider to be listenable may not always conform to othersâ€™ expectations. If there's a youngster or two involved, it's even more important to tone it all down.

 This collaboration between Harold Budd and Brian Eno is just perfect. Just restrained piano and sound treatments ala Eno makes a truly organic sounding masterwork.

 Just beautiful and most certainly NOT vinyl worthy. It's just too quiet.
