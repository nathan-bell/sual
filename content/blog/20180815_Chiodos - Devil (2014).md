### Another $2 random roulette choice from the big red shed. To be fair, this has some great and not-so-great moments.  
  
I think the good bits outweigh the less satisfying bits - so I'm not losing sleep over my impulsive purchase.Â   
  
It's proggy and inventive in places but the screamy/shouty bits I can definitely live without.

 Yes meets Green Day.
