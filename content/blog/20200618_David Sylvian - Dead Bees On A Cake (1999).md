### Succulent and syrupy, that's Mr. Sylvian. This is a recently updated double vinyl version of his late 90s record which I picked up for $29 on sale at JB-Hifi.   
  
While it's certainly not to everyone's taste this just oozes class. With Marc Ribot, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Bill Frisell along for the ride, it's no wonder.  
  
It's an eclectic mix of jazz, blues and crooning vocals that has a tendency to confuse and shake up the senses. Not for the faint of heart but like all of David Sylvian's records, is an event to savor occasionally.
