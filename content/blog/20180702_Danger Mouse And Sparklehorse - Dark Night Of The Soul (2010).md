### Some of my favourite vocalists appear on this final collaborative outing for Mark Linkous, who died just months before it's release.

 There's Jason Lytle (Grandaddy), Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals), Julian Casablancas (The Strokes), Black Francis (Pixies) and Wayne Coyne (Flaming Lips) all doing at least one track.  
  
All of the tracks are very much in the Sparklehorse/Mark Linkous vein and makes it all the more poignant.  
  
The only miss is the horrible Iggy Pop presentation. The best songs on this record are those with subtlety and invention. His musical persona does not fit in this collection one iota.
