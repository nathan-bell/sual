### Fantastic debut from New York-based group Asobi Seksu. While firmly in the noise rock genre, itâ€™s fabulously diverse throughout. On the very first listen there's a lot to like about this record.

 Vocals, sometimes in Japanese, mostly in English, are shared between Yuki Chikudate and James Hanna. 

 Musical influences are obvious without distracting from their unique sound. Sonic Youth, My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive and Blonde Redhead amonsgt others.
