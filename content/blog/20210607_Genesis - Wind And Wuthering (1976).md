### Two albums after Peter Gabriel left and the last record to feature guitarist Steve Hackett.

 To these ears, this is the last great classic(al) Genesis record. I will admit though, I do like a bit of their big hit, poppy stuff and even a bit of Phil in his prime.

 "Blood Oh The Rooftops" is the killer track and "Afterglow" a fitting end to their last above average record.
