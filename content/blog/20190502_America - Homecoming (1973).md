### Thereâ€™s really no shame these days in admitting you once enjoyed (and still do) the sonic aesthetic of the less than revered artists of yesteryear. 

 There once was a great deal of music snobbery back in the day that would single out whole genres of music. 

 Along with this band you could include The Eagles, The Doobie Brothers, Guess Who and even Bachman Turner Overdrive FFS!

 Recently alluded to in reference to Midlake, and reinforced by Brother Ricardo, America's "Ventura Highway" is a bona-fide classic.

 I have very fond memories of hearing this record at a very young age courtesy of my sister.
