### Bought this on a whim a while back. I had never listened to Microdisney prior to purchasing this, I'd just read glowing references. So this was more or less an impulse buy based on reputation.  
  
All I can say is what an absolutely criminally under-rated band.  

Just read the vitriolic user reviews in response to a less-than-favourable review from Allmusic.com of their 1985 record ["Clock Comes Down the Stairs"](https://www.allmusic.com/album/clock-comes-down-the-stairs-mw0000078812/user-reviews).  

This record contains most of the tracks from that record so I don't get why the reviewer would even think about giving this less that 5 stars. It's brilliant. 

This record reminds me of several fantastic but not immediately nameable bands rolled into one exceptional one.
