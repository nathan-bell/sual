### I remember like it was yesterday popping into one of many of my favourite record shops on my way home from school and hearing this complete game changer for the first time.  I'm not sure if I was music-industry savvy enough to have expected this "new" record but my god, what a moment.   
  
Remember this was 1977 and the music world was in complete turmoil as punk, temporarily at least, challenged the pomposity and pretentiousness of the mainstream majority.   
  
Somehow, Bowie seemed to be exempt from any critical examination and continued to also misalign with the mainstream. This was Bowie's bravest move and this record a mark of true genius. Unfortunately, I do not own this on vinyl.
