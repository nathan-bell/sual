### It's after 9pm on a Thursday evening. Kettley arrived home next door late afternoon and cranked up his Pearl Jam. (I'm so pleased I declared this on my 10 bands I fucking hate list!!)  
He's really blown it for me. I'm definitely in an anti-rock mood.

 This wonderful collaboration between Tim Bowness and Steven Wilson is just the tonic. Production qualities aside, this is rich, ambient and mesmerising.

 This recording completely eradicates the monotones of Eddie "let's get all political and ramble on in my half-octave vocal range for 10 minutes about fuck all" Vedder.Â
