### While this is deemed the first Porcupine Tree record, it's actually Steven Wilson's first solo album prior to any actual PT album, recorded in his bedroom studio under the pretense of it being a fully formed band.  
  
While it isn't representative of his future and prolific output under his many guises, it's a very clever and entertaining starting point. It's wacky, experimental and surprisingly psychedelic, something he doesn't really re-visit until his work with Blackfield.  
  
He's already quite the accomplished musician and producer even at this stage.

 By the way, I'm actively listening only to Steven Wilson-related stuff this month. There's an endless supply of material as you will see.
