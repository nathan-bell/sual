### This second record from Dublin's Fontaines (Dublin City) has that early 80's urgency that bands like Echo and the Bunnymen, The Fall and The Smiths had in spades. 

 This really takes me back to that time when things were epic.   
This is the most effing epic thing I've heard all year.

 Apparently, their first record is even better than this. Guess what I'm doing tomorrow.
