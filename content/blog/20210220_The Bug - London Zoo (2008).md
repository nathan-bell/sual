### Holy shit this is one intense slab of vinyl that does not relent over its 6 sides. The complete antithesis and double-handed middle finger to rock's bloated carcass, this is a welcome challenge that rips musical convention to shreds.

 It's far from easy listening but despite the suffocating intensity, it has so many hooks it's hard not to be floored - metaphorically and figuratively. Just don't expect your stereo to survive the onslaught.
