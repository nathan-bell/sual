### This guy can do no wrong. This record is highly likely to be voted by all music critics as the best album of 2017. DAMN is simply astounding!

 While not always a fan of Hip Hop, R'n'B and Rap, this is a big exception. Run The Jewels, Kayne West (yes, I know!) and Kendrick Lamar are my go to artists for contemporary and relevant ear candy.

 An embarrassment of riches and ingenuity. Musically and lyrically.
