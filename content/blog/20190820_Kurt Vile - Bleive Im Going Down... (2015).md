### Fantastic on first listen - this just hooks you in right from the needle drop. I've always avoided Kurt Vile because I was never sure what to expect. Talk about risk adverse!

 I picked up two Kurt Vile records, this and 2013's "Walkin' On A Pretty Daze", (both well endowed doubles), in a bargain bin from JB-Hifi in Melbourne for $29 each. After one play, this is possibly the single biggest surprise of 2019 so far.
