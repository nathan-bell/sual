### A recent Record Store Day vinyl compilation of a long lost, Japanese only CD from the long defunct Pale Saints (from Leeds)

 Pale Saints were often on my playlist back in the 90's and one of my 4AD staples. 

 Woefully underrated, they made a stonkingly great debut record in "The Comforts Of Madness".

 Challenging, if you have never been exposed to the murk that epitomises the 4AD sound. Heaven if you have.
