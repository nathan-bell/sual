### Quite a rare find yesterday. This record is pretty impossible to find and definitely one to grab if you can find it. 

 If you do like ethereal, muffled and largely indecipherable vocals, strummed acoustic guitar awash with reverb and barely perceptible electronics, then this will be right up your alley.

 Fortunately, I'm one of those alley dwellers and could happily listen to this dirge all day.
