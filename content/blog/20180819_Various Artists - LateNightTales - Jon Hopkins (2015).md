### I love the "LateNightTales" and "Back To Mine" compilation series curated by many guest musicians, over many years. Last count, [there's about 50!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Night_Tales)

Guest curators include: Rae & Christian (my first ever LNTs indulgence), Flaming Lips, Air, Sly & Robbie, Midlake, etc, etc.

This one is on the ambience side of things, but on a Sunday evening when one is contemplating the upcoming treadmill, it flows like warm syrup. mmmmm! Nice!
