### I paid nearly $7 for this gem at The Warehouse. It's just outrageous! My "five bucks" catch phrase is getting harder and harder to substantiate these days.  
  
Anyway, whatever I ended up paying it was worth it. This CD/DVD set was recorded at Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City back in 2005. She's got a great band behind her and familiar guests include Norah Jones, Ben Harper, Alison Krauss and Keb Mo.  
  
The musicianship is fantastic, and while there's a country blues flavour that predominates, it gets real funky at times. Her husky voice, silky slide and tasteful guitar licks never get tiresome.  
  
She's a true talent and I'll confess, a very recent discovery.
