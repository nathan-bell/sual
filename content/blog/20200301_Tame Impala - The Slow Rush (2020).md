### You know what, I’m getting sick of the same old same old.   
  
Three albums in and on the fantastic “Currents” Kevin Parker was getting flogged by the sky’s falling brigade for adding squelchy keyboards and turning his back on his guitar fuelled hazy psych.   
  
Like that wonderful record, those tunes never left and on this there’s further proof that the song crafting genius of Mr. Parker is still to the fore.    
  
This is on high rotation and grows in stature on each occasion.    
  
Another live performance to look forward to in mid-April.   
He’s (along with touring band) playing in Auckland along with other current darlings Khruangbin.
