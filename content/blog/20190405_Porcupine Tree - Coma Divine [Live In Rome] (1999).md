### Just grabbed some feel-good, proggy-pop-rock-metal-whatever-the-fuck-you-want-to-call-it this evening (it's Friday) and it's had an immediate pay off.

 You know the feeling when you just can't get it loud enough and it gets into your synapses and you think "holy fuck" how good is this!

 Mr. Wilson's got the old wah wah pedal out a lot on this performance and this is the Tree with the great Chris Maitland on drums. 

 I try to resist playing my favourite artists ad nauseum but it's hard when they became hardwired as "the good shit" in your brain.
