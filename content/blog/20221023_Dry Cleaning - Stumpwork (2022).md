### Dry Cleaning's 2021 debut, "New Long Leg" was up there with my favourite peri-COVID releases. Despite it being a bit more restrained, this new record ups the musical ante significantly.

 The band is now showing their superb chops and are central to Florence Shaw's quirky, spoken vocals instead of being merely her backing band. 

 While it's only an initial listen, I sense it's one of the headphone classics that demands more intimate interrogation.

 (I had a second listen a day later. It sounds exceptional!)
