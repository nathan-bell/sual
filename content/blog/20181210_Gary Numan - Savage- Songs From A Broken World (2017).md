### Here it is...and STILL my favourite record of the last 2 years. 

I bought the vinyl while in Auckland recently. As it stands, it's close to being my most vinyl-worthy record in my entire collection.

If it sounds immense on digital media (as it does) it sounds positively Brobdingnagian on big, hefty double vinyl. The only problem for me is not playing this fucker loud enough. I want my ears bleeding!
