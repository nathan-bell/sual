### I was helping to deliver my boy and his groomsmen to his wedding venue on Sunday, when Peter (my son) turned on the car stereo. A CD started to play.

 Bowie's "Changes" oozed from the speakers and Peter proceeded to sing along word for word.   
  
It made me proud!

 This record is over 45 years old but still seems relevant and ageless. While "Aladdin Sane" possibly had the greatest impact in shear audacity and decadence, this is probably my favourite Bowie record.
