### If you really want to kickstart your Krautrock adventures with smoking wheels there’s simply is no better place to start.

 This is a guitar-driven, all balls out, Meisterstück that is worthy of all accolades. OK it's 50 years old but has aged beautifully.

 Bought this off Smithies today. An original, nearly mint 1971 pressing. This fantastic record absolutely rocks the haus.
