### A very short lived but brilliant interim project from The Pixies' and Breeders' Kim Deal.

 I always thought that the Pixies and Breeders were misplaced on the 4AD label. Their quirkiness reminds of why they are.

 Raw and under-produced, it's just like having a band in your bedroom. Lo-fi at it's finest. "Hoverin" is especially dirgy!

 Kim Deal is definitely up there with Kristin Hersh as one of my favourite lady singers.
