### What a big old pleasant surprise this was then! I bought this at Real Groovy in Auckland recently with the carrot of a "$5 off" sticker gracing the front sleeve.

 I've adored Piano Magic for many a year and was expecting an average exit on this, their last tickle of the ivories. Incidentally, ANY Piano Magic album is well worth grabbing when you can - they are as rare as hen's teeth.

 The last album I'd spent any time with was 2005's "Disaffected". 13 years later any disappointment is completely blown into smithereens. Fucking marvellous!!
