### Always one of my favourite records, the importance of this landmark record by Iggy and The Stooges was reinforced this morning while on my Sunday ramble over to Raglan Roast.

 The last section of my walk coincided with listening to the "Sound Opinions" [podcast dissection of "Funhouse".](https://www.soundopinions.org/show/692/#thestooges)

 Held in the highest esteem by Greg Kot, he puts it up with The Beatles "Revolver" and The Stones "Exile On Main Street". The other reviewer, Jim DeRogatis, while he loves side 1 and track side on side 2, he loathes the free form noise of the last 2 tracks.

 Depending on mood, the tracks "Funhouse" and "L.A. Blues" can be simply unlistenable. Think Miles Davis meets The Velvet Underground and you come close.

 It's an amazing racket that is as frightening as it is confronting.
