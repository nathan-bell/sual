Leftfield disco classics from the New York Underground.   
  
This is another superb [compilation of New York weirdness](https://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2020/6/11/various-artists-new-york-noise-2003) of the late 70's to mid 80's.   
  
There's simply no more stock piling of straight forward, easy-to-get, retrospective, single artist/band recordings when you can have your mind (and wallet) altered by a great compilation such as this.   
  
Thanks for another great selection Smithies. He's now officially my vinyl broker!
