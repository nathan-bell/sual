### Universally loved or loathed, this debut record should have kick-started the demise of the dinosaurs. Unfortunately, no one was really listening.

 That destroy-all-boring-old-farts attitude didn't really arrive until the manufactured Pistols got all of the headlines a couple of years later. 

 These dudes, who Malcolm McLaren would eventually go on to ruin as well, were the real deal.
