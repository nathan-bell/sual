### Gavin Harrison is probably the world's best unknown drummer. 

 He's played bongos on many sessions for other musicians, but probably is best known (in the right circles) for his stick work with Porcupine Tree, The Pineapple Thief and the mighty King Crimson.

 During the Covid unpleasantness, which more or less coincided with him joining TPT fulltime, he went back through their catalogue and recorded many of their songs. This record is the result.

 It's a hefty, proggy revamp.
