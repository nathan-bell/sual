### Yet another ace ACE Records compilation lovingly curated by Bob Stanley. I continue to hoover these up like nose candy.

 This is happy clappy, hippy dippy, hip hop. R&B that doesnâ€™t take itself seriously in the slightest and is often bereft of any significant message. And all the better for it.
