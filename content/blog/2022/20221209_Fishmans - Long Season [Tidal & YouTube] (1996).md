### This amazing recording has been haunting my dreams lately (as well as causing a few offline listening nightmares on my iPhone with the finiky Tidal app)

 The 34 minute, single track is like nothing you have ever heard, and if you have the patience, has one of the most haunting melodies ever to hit your ears.

 [There's a fantastic 42 minute live version as well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkQ4uLXuy-A)

 Fishmans (Fisshumanzu) were a Japanese band formed in 1987 in Minato, Tokyo.

 I'm prepared to go down many rabbit holes in exploring this cult band further.
