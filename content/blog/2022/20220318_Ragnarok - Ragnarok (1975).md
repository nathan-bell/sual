### I may or may not have seen Ragnarok at the Racecourse Hotel, Hastings as a highschool lad back in the day.

 Whatever the case, I have very fond memories of this classic New Zealand Prog band and this record. 

 I now own a copy of this newly released record on some of the thickest, perfectly pressed vinyl I've ever seen. Spectacular.

 It also sounds fantastic. The most striking thing, aside from the great musicianship, is Lea Maalfrid's astounding vocals - somewhere between Geddy Lee and Jon Anderson.

 This is great New Zealand hippy dippy proggy rock that has dated beautifully.
