### I picked up Dope Lemon's second record, "Smooth Big Cat" a couple of trips back when I ventured across the big ditch to Melbourne. I've been looking for this release, the debut album, ever since.

 Dope Lemon is the hobby band of Angus Stone, baby brother of Julia, and fellow member of great Australian sibling duo, Angus & Julia Stone. 

 Along with the previously mentioned record, this follows a similar vein of chilled out, stoner bliss that's completely intoxicating. Love it!
