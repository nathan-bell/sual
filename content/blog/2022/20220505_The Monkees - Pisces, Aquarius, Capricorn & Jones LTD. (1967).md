### The evening started out with a Monkees sampler. I’d just play side 1 of each of the 3 long players I’ve got of theirs. OK, I managed to get through the first side of “The Monkees” and “More Of The Monkees” (both fabulous) but hit a snag on this one. It’s simply too good to skip.   
  
I picked this original NZ pressing up in Waipawa in VG+ condition. It sounds crystal clear and nearly as pristine as the brand new analogue pressing I’ve just acquired. It’s very rare to find a 55 year old record that sounds as good as this. What a brilliant record!
