### OK, I wasn't expecting this.

 Purchased mainly for it's slightly unhinged cover, and because it was going cheap, I was a bit worried that this would be some weird, inaccessible, electronic squawlk fest.

 Oh how wrong one can be! Aside from being a fabulous sounding recording with hefty bass and ultra crisp instrumentation, it's a proper little dance-floor, jazz-raver.

 Perfect for a quiet, slightly damp afternoon. Return To Forever meets Goldie.
