### Not a bad haul this. I got all three Appliance CD's, including this debut, super dirt cheap at the big red shed during peak multi-format media acquisition days.

 It was exciting heading down to The Warehouse every odd day and expecting to always come away with something great. In this case it wasn't fully realised until quite a few years later.

 I have probably never played this or the other two Appliance CDs but I will certainly make up for lost time. It is exceptional. Krautrock, post-punk, dirge with just enough wah wah to keep it flowing like molasses.

 This trio hail(ed) from Exeter.
