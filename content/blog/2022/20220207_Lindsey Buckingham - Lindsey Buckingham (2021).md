### This is a remarkable comeback record for the 72 year old, ex Fleetwood Mac guitar and song writing maestro.

 Ousted from the band in 2018, probably mostly by his own doing, and battling major health issues, he's made a record that could sit alongside those BIG Mac records of the mid-70s.

 I've always admired his fantastic finger picking guitar style and he really delivers on this. 

 Not only that, as it states on the inner sleeve, "Performed, Produced and Engineered by Lindsey Buckingham".  
Heâ€™s the only musician on this record.
