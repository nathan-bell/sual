### On paper, I should probably hate this band. Instead, and despite their electronic, dance-focused, clubiness I fully imbrace all they have done. (This is especially true when there's a $2 price tag on the CD case).

 They are not unlike an amalgam of the best bits of Erasure, Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode and even Talking Heads when their funky, soulfoul coolness comes to the fore.

 I picked this up in a used CD bin in Rotorua. Production and persistent ear candy really pop on this one.
