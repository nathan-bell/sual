### This all instrumental, trance-inducing long player from Stereolab's Tim Gane, while not far removed from the Labs mesmeric soundscapes, is sans his dirty old, reverb-rich, overdriven Jaguar and replaced with an all analogue, knob-twiddling, (over)indulgence.

 And that's not a bad thing - it's a real treat! There's clearly an early Krautrock flavour to proceedings and in places thereâ€™s a wonderful Tangerine Dream vibe about it all. Most excellent.
