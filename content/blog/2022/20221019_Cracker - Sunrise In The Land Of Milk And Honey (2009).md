### I had a bit of a field day in Auckland during the weekend hunting for those (not so elusive) CD bargains. With some success I might add. While new CD releases are creeping over the $30 mark, thereâ€™s bins and bins of aging, unloved stock, going for mere pittance. 

 Now this record (their 9th) from Richmond, Virginia-based alt-alt-country rockers, Cracker, continues their tradition of oddly poppy little belters. I paid $2.50 for this.

 Incidently, leader and vocalist David Lowery, was a founding member of the equally wonderful Camper Van Beethoven.
