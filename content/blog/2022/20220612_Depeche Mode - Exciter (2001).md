### The argument about vinyl vs digital media is thrown right out the window when you stick a remuxed, DVD-Audio disc such as this into a half-decent media player.

 The moment the full on mids and treble hits your ears and the bass rumbles your viscera, you know why you've kept the good stuff.

 This CD/DVD set is one of many Hi-Res discs that I've held onto knowing that this really is the benchmark for fabulous sound.

 Unless you spend thousands on a high-end vinyl playing turntable, an equally expensive moving coil cartrige, multiple, tube-based audio components AND large finicky speakers, you simply can't compare it to this.

 While it's not their best record, it sounds magnificent!
