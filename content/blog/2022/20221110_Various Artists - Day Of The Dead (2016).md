### I can’t say I’ve ever (intentionally) listened to The Grateful Dead. If I have in the past, its hardly been memorable. 

 A reassessment is probably called for, but to be honest, I’m not diving in beyond this 60 track complilation of covers. Thats already a five and a half hour investment. 

 Now this 5CD compilation, which I picked up in Auckland in the bargain bin, is proving to be a great way to hear "dead-to-me" songs. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.
