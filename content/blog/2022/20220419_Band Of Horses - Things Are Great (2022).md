### This is a fantastic return to top form. This is a band that just keeps being themselves.

 Considering that it's been 6 years since their last album, 2016's "Why Are You OK?", it would be easy to go off in a new direction.

 Some pretty ridiculous things have happened during their hiatus; Trumps been and gone, a Pandemic has been and going, and World War three's starting real soon.

 Despite all of that, most importantly, Band Of Horses deliver a new record that I will probably play to death.
