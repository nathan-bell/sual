### Recorded in Saskatoon (Saskatchewan?) Nashville and Lyttelton, this country and western tinged folk record is a brilliantly realised collaberation between Cananadian duo Kacy Lee Anderson and Clayton Linthcium, of Kacy & Clayton, and New Zealand wunderkid, Marlon Williams. A beautiful, cathartic gem recorded just prior to the Covid unpleasantness.

 This evening I have been listening on:

-  White vinyl on Project 2Xpression turntable with Ortofon M10 Blue stylus/cartridge into:
-  NAD C 365BEE Integrated Amplifier via Phono (MM) RCAs and out through:
-  Bowers & Wilkens 683 (200 Watt) floor standing speakers.
