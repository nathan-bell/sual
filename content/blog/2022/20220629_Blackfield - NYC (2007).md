### Blackfield - Recorded live at the Bowery Ballroom, NYC on 16th March 2007

 OK, I've decamped all of my boxed up digital media and it's living and breathing once more.

 The first thing I reach for is "old faithful". It's never let me down before, it never will. 

 Life would be so wonderful if things were this simple. WYSIATI What You See Is All There Is!

 Fucking outstanding.
