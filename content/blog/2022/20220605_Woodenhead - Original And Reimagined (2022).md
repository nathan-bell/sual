### This beyond extraordinary New Zealand film from 2003 definitely wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea (or cup oâ€™ sick!).

 I'm not even going to attempt to explain it or even recommend it - if you want to know more,[check it out here](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388544/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). Check out the great 1/10 star rating   - it explains things very well.

 The soundtrack is a wonderful thing even if you never managed to get through the film. The reimagined tracks, however, really enhance the experience.

 Definitely not for the normals.
