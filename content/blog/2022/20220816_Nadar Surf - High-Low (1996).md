### I heard a great song, "Popular" by this New York-based band on a recent podcast. I really needed to check them out a bit more.

 While there's some obvious Weezer geek rock comparisons, and it's clearly of that time, it's a very satisfying listen. 

 Also on the musical menu, samples of:

-  Simple Minds - New Gold Dream (I forgot how good this record is)
-  Singapore Sling - Killer Classics (stunning Icelandic, ice-cold dirgey post-punk)
-  Kiss - Music From The Elder (A Prog masterpiece?!)
-  Various Artists - Jazz Dispensary Super Skunk
