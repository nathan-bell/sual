### This is without any doubt at all, one of my favourite music documentaries of all time.

 This feature length doco highlights the magesty and splendor of Icelandic music.

 While it's focus is mainly on indie rock, there's some legendary performances acorss the spectrum of classical and contemporary music.

 Regardless of genre, Icelandic music is the epitome of unrestrained/unshackled joy in the making of beautiful noise.
