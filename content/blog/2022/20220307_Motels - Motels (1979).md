### This record was on high rotation during the late 70's, early 80's as punk gave way to the much richer and diverse palate of post-punk/new wave.

 The stand out track, "Total Control" still sounds menacing, tasty saxophone solo and all, and the album is worth having just for that singe track alone.

 I picked this little gem up in Waipawa still in pretty good nick. It sounds great.

 While not really appreciated at the time, or by Allmusic.com, I thinks its an unheralded classic.
