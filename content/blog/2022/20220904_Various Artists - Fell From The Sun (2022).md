### Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs present downtempo and after hours 1990-91

 Another stupendous ACE Records compilation curated by fellow clevor Trevor's Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs.

 When they aren't making startlingly good dance/indie pop with their own band, Saint Etienne, they are busy showcasing the genius of others.

 This is a fabulous archive of similarly chilled, floaty, mid-tempo music from a very distinct period when Dance and House Music ruled.

 Don't let that put you off however, it's music your granny would boogie to.
