### My usual bag of coffee beans has gone up by $2.50 over the last couple of months. WTF! Now that’s serious and potentially troublesome for my boy and his two-cups-of-my-coffee-a-day habit.  

 What is also problematic is the increasing cost of owning music. This 5 track vinyl EP cost me $55. 

 If it wasn’t such a great record and a worthy followup to their “Texas Sun” release of 2020, I’d be very hesitant to part with my hard earned cash.

 It really is a cost of living crisis when you would seriously think about depriving a family member of their caffiene fix. This record is the crema on that coffee. Smooth as.
