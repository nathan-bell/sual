### One of my favourite first songs on any record in my collection is Luna's "Chinatown" from their album Penthouse. This new record from legendary\* Kiwi Muscian Dean Wareham, reignites that moment.

 Of course, it was Dean Wareham's distinctive voice on that record.  

 \*Why Dean Wareham is not more revered here in New Zealand, I really don't know. As the front man of Galaxy 500, a hugely influential American band as well as Luna, AND Dean & Britta, he's really something special.
