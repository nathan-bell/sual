### As a semi-completist Bowie-phile, I was inspired to acquire this 3CD box of revisited, pre-fame, early recordings.

 As a school kid in the early 70's, and before I really knew who David Bowie was, I remember listening to the 1967 record "David Bowie".

 It was a bunch of silly, but catchy tunes more reminiscent of Herman's Hermits. There were some great songs though.

 The recording session where this album came from was just after his brilliant performance at Glastonbury in 2000 and includes Earl Slick, Mike Garson, Gail Ann Dorsey and Lisa Germano.   
It took another two decades to release it.
