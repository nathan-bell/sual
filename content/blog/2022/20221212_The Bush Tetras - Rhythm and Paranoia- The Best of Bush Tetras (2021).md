### This beautifully presented box set from New York funky punk pioneers Bush Tetras, is a fabulous compilation of their best moments accross 6 sides of vinyl.

Included is a great 50 page biography, full discography and testimonials from other musicians recognising their importance in marrying dance music with punk. 

Many banjo-welding, mono-dimensional music appreciators were harmed in the playing of this record.
