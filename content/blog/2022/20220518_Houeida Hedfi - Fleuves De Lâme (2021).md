### This is beyond categorisation, it just "is". 

 Without deconstructing things too much, this wonderful recording by Tunisian multi-instrumentalist Houeida Hedfi, combines traditional folk music with an extraordinary array of contemporary genres.

 Produced by one of my favourites, and only recently realised, Olof Dreijer of The Knife. I'm sure it will reveal more of it's beauty and stunning textures during repeated listens.
