### This is music that simply stops me in my tracks. It's not just a casual listen, it takes over every synapse and sinew.

 While the highly processed vocals sound like they are from another planet, the incredible drumming and rythms sound organic and tribal.

 Poliça hail from Minnesota. They sound like no one else.
