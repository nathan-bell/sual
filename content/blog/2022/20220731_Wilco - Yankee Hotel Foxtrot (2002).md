### When Alt-Country does Radiohead. This was absolutely panned by Wilco's record company and seen as commercial suicide. Wilco refused to budge and left the label.

 They proved the soothsayers wrong. 

 This was probably the start for me when I sought more of this angst ridden, musically noodly Americana. The electronic embellishment made this exploration real easy.

 This sounds absolutely fabulous as I continue to rediscover my CD collection. My local vinyl crack dealer is giving me the evil eye as I push back.

 I saw the vinyl version of this the other day. It was just shy of $80. I rest my cast.
