### To these ears this is one of the best records that Pavement didn’t make. 

 While you could say that the Flying Nun label mates of this Auckland-based outfit taught the Paves a thing or two, this group are just as effective at playing sloppy, effortless and slightly off kilter pop music like the big boys of the era.

 However, despite this, there’s an undeniable Kiwi flavour.
