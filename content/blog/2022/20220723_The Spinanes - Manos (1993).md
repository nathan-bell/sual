### Chicago two piece, Rebecca Gates, guitar and vocals, and Scott Plouf, on drums, make such a wonderful racket together.

 While it's inherently a narrow soundstage, the chemistry and synchronicity between the duo is palpable.

 I'm not sure how I acquired this, but it's one of my favourites from this era (and any era for that matter)
