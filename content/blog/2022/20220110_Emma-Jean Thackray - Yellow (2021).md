### Starting of with a discordant mess worthy of "Jazz Club" \*, this record quickly asserts itself as a mix of 70's jazz fusion, funk and cosmic greatness.

 While not usually my bag, it's a gas to be out of one's depth, and loving it!  

 Emma-Jean Thackray is a very clever English born, horn playing multi-instrumentalist and singer, and this is her exceptional debut record.

 Grrrrreat!

 *\* Presenter of The Fast Show's "Jazz Club", Louis Balfour was a man whose mission was to bring 'you all that's best in the world of jazz'.  Every obscure and bizarrely named jazz combo who join him in the studio was greeted with the Louis' particular brand of cool reverence. Nice!*
