### Another selection from my penny each, CD haul from the Red Cross shop. There's almost nothing much on the interweb about this Melbourne-based band or this recording.

 It's all very nice but unremarkable. Noodly, textural electronica that might soundtrack a prime-time soap that's trying to be cool.
