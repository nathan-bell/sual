### The only full-priced CD I bought during my sojourn to Auckland was this Pavement 2022 Redux.

As a completist, this sits very nicely on my CD shelf along with the other 4 remastered/extended editions.

This was Pavement's last record and despite the expected, controlled racket, it's showing signs of a nuanced sophistication that Stephen Malkmus would carry on with his future solo career.

Beautifully packaged and presented, this CD kicks some serious Vinyl arse. Try packing these 45 tracks on vinyl. You'd need a trailer and a re-mortgage!
