### I'm not really sure how I feel about this record - I'm listening to it as I type. This is the first time I've heard this since acquiring it as part of the massive "Brilliant Adventure" box.

 It's basically a rehash of some of his pre-fame, 60's songs modernised and given some extra heft by a pretty slick band. (There's a pun in there - Earl Slick, who is actually name dropped on "I Dig Everything" plays guitar throughout).

 I'm up to the end of side two, and it sounds pretty good actually. It's not vintage Bowie, but it's nice to have as part of this package. There's an expensive box set solely dedicated to "Toy".  However, this is enough of it for me. (That might change however during one of those 25% off sales?!)

 It's coming up to 6 years since David Bowie died on January 10th, 2016.
