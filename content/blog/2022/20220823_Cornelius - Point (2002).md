### If you can find a better sounding CD than this, I'll eat my entire vinyl collection.

 I can't even contemplate why you would ever listen to this on anything other than a CD or via decent streaming media. (ok, there's a couple of DVD versions which I also own but it's still all digital).

 This sounds truly amazing with an enormous, punchy soundstage and ear melting stereo separation. However, while it's pure ear candy, and undoubtedly a work of true genius, it's not sustainable. 

 It would wear you down like a blunt stylus on the grooves of a dirty record. Just saying!
