### This record encompasses everything I like but is also unlike anything else I like. Does that make any sense? I really doesnâ€™t need to. 

 Trying to explain it would be like deconstructing a Jackson Pollock painting or explaining a black hole. There's just no point.

 Its not really trying to be anything. Like the best things in life - it just is.
