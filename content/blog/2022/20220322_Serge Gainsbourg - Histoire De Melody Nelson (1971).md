### I recently found a copy of this absolute masterpiece on vinyl during my recent travels. It's a 2009 USA pressing produced by USA label "Light In The Attic Records".

 Aside from being a stunning pressing, the Stoughton cover is ridiculously hefty and it also includes an anti-static insert. Now that's the trifecta in my book!

 Those North Americans certainly know how to package their vinyl - I just wish this would rub off on other vinyl makers and distributors. 

 Records are expensive, and the majority of them come in the equivalent of sand paper.

 Any how, this record is fantastic.
