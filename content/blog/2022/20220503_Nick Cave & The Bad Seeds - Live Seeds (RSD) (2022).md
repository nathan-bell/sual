### Originally recorded during his "Henry's Dream" tour of 1993, this includes some truly incendiary versions of some stonking tunes across several albums.

 "The Good Son" is probably my favourite record of his and there are several fantastic tracks from that.

 This was one of the very few Record Store Day releases that was half decent. He remains one of the most mesmerising performers I've ever seen.
