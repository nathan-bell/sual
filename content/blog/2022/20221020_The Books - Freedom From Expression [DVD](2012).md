### I picked this DVD up in Auckland recently at Flying Out Records. It was sitting all alone, on a dusty old shelf, well removed from the tsunami of vinyl.

 The high resolution format of the media makes for a stunning, full-on listening experience. That would be fine in itself.

 When you need further evidence of their genius, you quickly realise that the visuals are inseparable from the music.

 Just brilliant.
