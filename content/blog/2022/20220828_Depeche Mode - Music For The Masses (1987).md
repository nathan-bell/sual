### I'm just loving rediscovering my big wall of sound. This big multi-level shelf of plastic and card-board cases hold the majority of my CDs, SACDs and DVD-Audio/Blu-ray discs.

 They are no longer gathering dust. 

 This album from the late 80's is the start of my serious, now out-of-the-closet, Depeche Mode fixation.

 I picked up this 2 disc Hybrid SACD/DVD re-release at The Warehouse back in the day for a pittance. You'd be lucky to find it these days for less than $150.

 Like vinyl, old CDs are creeping up in value.
