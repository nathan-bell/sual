### This Melbourne outfit is another great discovery of late. Really hard to pigeon hole into any genre. As it says on the hype sticker "...this is inspired by funk, library music, cinematic scores, soul, psych-folk-rock and wonky synths."

 It's also hip-hoppy, without the vocals. Mystery man, Snooch Dodd, hangs it all together. There's obviously something in the water. Exceptional.
