### I managed to pick up one of only 200 copies of this, the Record Store Day release version, on beautiful yellow and blue vinyl.

 This beautifully packaged, re-released and remastered LP and EP (the wonderful "pulsing") was one of the first electronica records made in New Zealand.

 I remember buying both the EP, which came out first, then the LP when it landed back in the day. 

 Having not played it for at least three decades, I must say, it sounds fantastic. While I wouldn't say it's timeless, it does stand up really well as a truly great Kiwi record.
