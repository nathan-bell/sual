### I was NOT prepared for this! Even my watch protested about the noise of the first track - screaming out something 'bout "...exceeding decibels...30 minutes...potential damage..." It wasn't just the volume; it was the shear harshness of the assault.

 This is one of those records with should really have a warning sticker to warn "normal" music listeners about physical AND psychological damage. It's not for everyone.

 What it is though is a remarkable musical event that simply unfolds with so much invention and meandering brilliance, you don't necessarily wish it was over.

 As someone so succently puts it on their review on Amazon, "Shreds your ears, melts your mind". Exactly.
