### This is a record that is bulging at the seams with wonderful invention and brilliant performance.

 If you have the patience, it's a proper roller coaster experience. 

 Over its 75 minutes, it's basically the history of rock'n'roll. 

 What's incredible, this is his 15th record since 2008, and he's done another 5 since this one!

 His cover of Hot Chocolate's "Every 1's A Winner" is worth the price of admission alone.
