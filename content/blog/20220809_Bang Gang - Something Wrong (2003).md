### The wonderful film "Screaming Masterpiece" introduced me to many great Icelandic musicians. 

 There were many "wow" moments throughout this music documentary and it ultimately led me to this "band" and this astounding record. 

 Bang Gang is really the work of one Barði Jóhannsson. This is where Portishead meets Mew. 

 So good, I played it twice!
