### Sometimes you just need a bit of cheerful, happy clappy positivity in your life. Things are all a bit grim at the moment.   
  
This brand new album from LA-based Grouplove is just the ticket. While environmentally and socially aware in their message, it’s never preachy. Just look after each other.  “Let’s do some shit we won’t remember. We’ll be great pretenders”    
  
I saw them live at The Electric Ballroom in Camden a few years ago. It was more about seeing a band play at that famous venue than knowing much about them. One of the most memorable and fun gigs I’ve ever been to.
