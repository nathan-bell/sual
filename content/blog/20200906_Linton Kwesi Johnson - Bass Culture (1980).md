### This is a great relic and snapshot of life in Thatcher's England. "Inglan is a bitch, there's no escaping it!"   
  
While it is politically and socially charged in places, (Mr Johnson could really getaway with singing about anything), the reggae/dub soundtrack in support of Linton's wonderful prose is just fabulous!   
  
This big 200g double vinyl release is a limited edition "Record Store Day" release. It's now a new treasure in my collection.
