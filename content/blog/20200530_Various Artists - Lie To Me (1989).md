 This year, as Jessie from the "Fast Show" would say, I have been mainly eating compilations.  
  
In a most cases this makes for more enjoyable and "active" listening sessions as opposed to just recycling old CDs or "safe" vinyl.   
  
Listening to a compilation such as this, is like having a repeatable radio show that never becomes overly familiar. And actually the more obscure the artist, the better.     
  
This 1989 compilation of independent bands from the "Umbrella" label are a motley bunch. The production is questionable at best and the music is abrasive and minimalist.    
  
Like the wonderful "Television Personalities" (which I purchased on bright red vinyl today), the songs and palpable energy raises it above anything overly contrived.
