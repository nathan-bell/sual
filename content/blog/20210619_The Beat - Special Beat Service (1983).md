### Known as "The English Beat" in North America to allay any clash and confusion with the American "The Beat", these dudes were right in the thick of things with other budding SKA bands of the time.

 This great sounding 2012 remaster courtesy of a Warehouse bargain bin, is rich and toe tappingly engaging. Just ripe for the picking on this less than stellar Saturday afternoon.
