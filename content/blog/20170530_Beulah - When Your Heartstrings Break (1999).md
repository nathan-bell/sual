### Wonderful, but short lived, indie alt-country rockers from San Francisco. This record, their second, is just full of magical hooks and glorious melodies.

 Vocalist Miles Kurosky is a more restrained Jeff Tweedy, but has a similar presence as band leader and chief inventor.

 A beautifully produced record, with lots of strings and horns and sounding a little Beatlesque in places.Â My only criticism is that the record ends too quickly.
