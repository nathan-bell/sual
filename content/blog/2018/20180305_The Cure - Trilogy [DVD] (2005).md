### I’m not sure why a fat, mascara-dripping, lipstick-smeared, aging gothic clown with big hair playing the most maudlin dirge on the world’s ugliest guitar is so engaging.   
  
This 2005 concert, staged in Berlin, includes the album “Disintegration” in it’s entirety, and it’s the fucking cat’s pajamas. Possibly their best record performed to a very appreciative German crowd. 

 I might stick to visual media this month. Give those old DVDs and Blu-rays an outing.
