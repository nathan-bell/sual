### It's a fucking outrage that this record isn't even listed on [Dimmer's discography](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dimmer-mn0000399787/discography) on Allmusic.com

 Not only is this one of NZ's best ever records, it's an extraordinary example of world class songcraft and production. There's not many records that sound this rich! (Your stereo better be fit to play this gem).

 This is one of my albums that I would play at least once a year to cleanse away any complacency that may be creeping in. Simply stunning.
