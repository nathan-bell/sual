### I threw a "T" and reached into my alphabetised "T" section for this little gem. And it really is a wee gem.  This is Tracey Thorn's 2nd solo album following the dissolution of "Everything But The Girl".   
  
What remains perfectly intact, after many years completely absent from any music production, is that unique and magnificent voice. There simply isn't another voice like it.  
  
If hearing the voice wasn't enough, the beautiful and melodic ditties that accompany it are perfectly (under)stated. $1.50 from the Warehouse.
