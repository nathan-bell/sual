### This very strong debut catapulted this band into indie superstardom and you can hear why. (actually, prior to putting it on I had forgotten it was their first record!).  
  
While I've been saturated a bit over the years with old shaky, there's a distinct early Neil Young influence, but without the sonic histrionics. It's more about density and subtlety for these boys. (a bit dichotomous I know).  
  
It's rich, harmonious and uplifting.
