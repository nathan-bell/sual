### This husband and wife led Quebecois collective hail from Montreal, home of Arcade Fire. While their sound is just as monstrous it definitely feels like it comes from another planet altogether.  
  
Take equal parts The Beach Boys, Pink Floyd and My Bloody Valentine and you get the picture. It's a fascinating combination that never settles the senses.  
  
This is their fifth proper album and is potentially vinyl worthy.Â
