### It's a hard job staying relevant in the music world when what is deemed "the best years" are close to 25 years ago.   
  
In the world of electronic dance music it is even more difficult not to sound dated. Luckily for Underworld, they still sound just like Underworld (but without the irreplaceable Darren Emerson)  
  
While not as brilliantly abrasive as the truly pioneering Cabaret Voltaire or as abrasively brilliant as the not-from-this-planet Chrome, they do occupy a similar spot in my world where rock merges comfortably with electronic dance and trance music.
