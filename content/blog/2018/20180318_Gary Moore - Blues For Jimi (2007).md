### OK, I completely missed St. Paddy’s day despite encountering numerous green-haired, Guinness lugging, thin white dudes through out the day yesterday.   
  
My mind was obviously fixated on the England vs Ireland Rugby test in the wee hours of Sunday morning. (By the way, the Irish did the clean sweep so more reason to party hard on the real (GMT) St.Paddy’s day).  
  
I therefore acknowledge the day with a live recording from one of Ireland’s finest musicians.

 This is an astonishing live recording from 2007 and dedicated to the music of Jimi Hendrix. Gary Moore is on top form here and is joined for a couple of tracks by Billy Cox and Mitch Mitchell.   
  
For me, “Red House” is the real highlight with the two original band members. He captures the spirit of Hendrix, tonally and technically, as well as adding his own unique idiosyncrasies to the mix. 

 Unfortunately, Gary Moore died in Spain while on tour in 2011 at the ripe old age of 58. An immense talent snuffed out way too early by the evils of alcohol. He does Jimi proud on this record.
