### Ok "Wired" was my first exposure to Geoffrey Arnold Beck, and what a watershed moment that was!!!!!. However,  this record lives on as my favourite JB recording.  
  
I have just finished watching a great recent BBC documentary "Jeff Beck: Still On The Run". This augments his great biography, "Hot Wired Guitar" beautifully.

 This gets it's yearly outing this evening.
