### OK, I won't piss around. This is one of the most pretentious, grandiose and utterly brilliant albums in my entire collection.  
  
When I just want something reliable to listen to that will take me into another stratosphere, this is it. These Danes just do stuff that messes with my head. It's another record that stops you in your tracks and renders you useless. 

 No wonder Christian Eriksen (star Danish midfielder for Spurs) plays such a majestic game of footy. His head is in the clouds with these guys.
