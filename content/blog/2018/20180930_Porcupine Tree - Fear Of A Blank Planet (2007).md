### Simply put, this is probably the most perfect Steven Wilson/Porcupine Tree release in the entire SW catalogue. It's a big subjective statement to make but it's hard to prove otherwise on the strength of this brilliant record.

 This is a damn near flawless, guitar-driven master-work. At only 50 minutes long it still boasts one of his longest tracks, the sublime "Anesthetize" at over 17 minutes. 

 Along with "The Battle Of Epping Forest", "Thick As A Brick" and "Wish You Were Here", "Anesthetize" is a true progressive masterpiece.
