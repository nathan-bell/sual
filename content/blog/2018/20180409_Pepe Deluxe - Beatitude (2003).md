### This Monday night debrief requires serious frivolity. This under-the-radar masterpiece is filled with an impossible array of the most luxurious sounds courtesy of two very clever Finnish wax spinners.  
  
The brilliance of this recording does not wane for one second. When the quality is of such a high standard that’s just about impossible.

 I’m not sure how I acquired this gem, but bugger me it’s good! I regularly forget just how great it is. This absolutely belongs in everyone’s collection.
