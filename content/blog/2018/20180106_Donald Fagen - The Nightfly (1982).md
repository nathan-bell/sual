### One of my all time favourite records. The day has come to give it it's annual outing in wonderful 5.1 DTS surround.

 The Don never sounded more alive than on this record. It's a wonder though, both he and Becker were at an all time low at the time of and following the release of Gaucho.

 It would take them a couple of decades to recover. The Don not recording again until the mid 90's.
