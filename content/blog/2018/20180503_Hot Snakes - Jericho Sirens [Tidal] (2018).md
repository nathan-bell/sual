### What a fucking glorious racket!!  This recently discovered quintet hail from San Diego and this monster is their first release in 14 years.  
  
All I can say is this relentless mess is a breath of fresh air. The Stooges meet Sonic Youth is as close as I can get.   
  
I heard about this album on a "Sound Opinions" podcast showcasing "buried treasure". I liked what I heard and within 5 minutes I was listening to it via Tidal.

 The song "Six Wave Hold-Down" is in my head for eternity.
