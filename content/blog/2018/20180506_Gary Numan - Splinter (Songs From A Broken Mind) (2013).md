### Along with last year's wonderful "Savage", this earlier release just ticks so many boxes.Â It's dark. It's heavy. It's impossibly catchy and it's possibly the most unfashionable record in my entire collection.  
  
I bought the limited 2 CD edition at Slow Boat in Wellington today, without hesitation. It cost me $20. It will be played to death.  
  
Gazza returns with a vengenance!
