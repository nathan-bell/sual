### Faultless post-H端sker D端 record from their legendary front man.  
  
Despite a brain melting wall of guitars, it's the hook of great melody amidst all of that power that prevails over everything else.  
  
Possibly singlehandedly responsible for alternative music and grunge, Bob Mould (and his H端sker D端 mates) made some truly influential records that were totally underappreciated at the time.  
  
This record was redemption time at least for Bob Mould. It's a brilliant record from start to finish.
