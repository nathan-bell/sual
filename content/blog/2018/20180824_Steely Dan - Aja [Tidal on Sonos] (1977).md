### Home on a Friday evening with Tuesday's SUAL session still reverberating. I reach for my iPhone and dial in The Dan.  
  
While "The Royal Scam", one of Martin's big three, is high on my preferred Steely Dan list, it's "Aja" that is always my SD go-to record. The lush, jazz infused sounds ooze from the speakers.  
  
The Drambuie has hit the sweet spot and I'm in the zone. The fire is crackling and the weekend has just begun.  
  
Life can be very simple and highly satisfying when The Don from The Dan isn't spitting on you and you are safe and sound in your little slice of heaven.
