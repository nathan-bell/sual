### I'm in a very specific mood this afternoon as tensions build towards Sunday's big event (my lad's wedding day).

 I tried to listen to one of my bargain bin haul items (Jaco Pastorious - Jaco OST) but that was no where near up to scratch and lasted a couple of tracks. 

 I then spent the next 20 minutes trying to decide on something suitable before picking this release from 2011.

 It's just got the right amount of atmosphere, melody, chaos and emotion to engage with my slightly troubled demeanour.
