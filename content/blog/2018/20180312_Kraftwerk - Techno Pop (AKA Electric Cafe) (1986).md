### While not held in the same regard as an “Autobahn” or “The Man Machine”, this mid-80’s effort remains one of my favourite Kraftwerk records.  
  
Going back more than a decade in time prior to the release of this record, I’ll never forget first hearing “Autobahn” on the radio in the kitchen of our family home as a 14 or 15 year old. It was on a [Casey Kasem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDYK2H0ldbo) Top 40 show for God's sake!  
  
I can recall this moment like it was yesterday. That's the power of this ear candy stuff - it will go on and haunt you forever!
