### A very classy, post-break-up-with-hubby record produced by T Bone Burnett. There's some real texture and reverby guitar added to proceedings that is in real contrast to her previous "clean" rockabilly recordings.

 This isn't to say her previous records haven't been brilliant, they are all exceptional. It's just such a refreshing move for her to dirty things up a bit.

 Jeff Beck guests on one track - showing off some very restrained and tasteful slide guitar while Marc Ribot and T Bone Burnett share most of the guitar duties throughout. All in all a fantastic and gritty redirection for the sultry Irish songstress.
