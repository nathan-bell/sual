### These Nebraskins are clearly locked inside a mid-80's time warp. There's lots of electronic noodling, trance-like ridums and some ever so pleasingly analogue synths at play. Vocals are frenetically shared by all three band members who are named Sarah, Nik and Derek.  
Â   
However, while there are great moments, there are some equally not-so-great moments. It meanders in places and lacks a bit of substance and structure. When it does click, it does so in spades.  
  
Very much a 50/50 $2 discovery.
