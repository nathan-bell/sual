### "The Pod" and especially "Pure Guava" was my (and fellow SUAL'er Martin's) introduction to the absurd but incredibly inventive and musically proficient Ween.  
The track "Spinal Meningitis (Got Me Down)", introduced to the group by Nathan, was one of the many highlights of a great Shut Up and Listen session at Brother Ricardo's headquater's last night.Â  Half music/half banter, it was a frequently revelatory session for all.

 After hearing the offending/offensive track, I made an immediate promise to get my Ween out. It's by no means as bad as it sounds.  
  
While it's a record that's most definitely not for grown up, serious people, you should probably avoid playing "Mister Would You Please Help My Pony", "Baby Bitch" and "Don't Eat Where You Shit" anywhere near Christians, young people and the elderly. Aside from that, it's a record that should be in everyone's collection. Essential.
