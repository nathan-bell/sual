### Orange Juice was never one of my favourites but like any good beverage, it can be an acquired taste. Sipped slowly and mixed with other flavours.

 Edwyn Collins, and the wonderful, "A Girl Like You", came along first in 1994. I've since gone back and listened to much of his Orange Juice output via [this sensational collection.](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14878-coals-to-newcastle/)

 One of Scotland's greatest exports.
