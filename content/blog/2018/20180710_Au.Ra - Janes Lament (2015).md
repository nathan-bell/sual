### Mesmeric debut from Sydney duo Au.Ra. I'm not prepared to put a label on it but it's up there with a couple of other favourite and recent Aussie releases. Beaches "Second Of Spring" and Belligerents "Science Fiction".  
  
This was another $2 throwaway from the Red Shed which has clearly paid back huge dividends on it's very first outing.Â 

 While the Aussies have definitely fallen from grace in the sporting sphere of late, the psych-hazy-dreampop stratosphere is all theirs. Love it!
