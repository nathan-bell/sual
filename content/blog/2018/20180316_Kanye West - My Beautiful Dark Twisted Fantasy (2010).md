### Anyone who thinks Kanye West is a total and talentless plonker should be strapped to a chair and made to listen to this all the way through. (OK he is a complete plonker but oh no no, he's definitely not talentless!)  
  
Give it a second listen and you'll soon be begging for your next fix. Possibly my most played record in the last five years. While it's Hip Hop, it's also what I'd call genre agnostic.Â   
There's some big rock moments including a wonderful sample of the late, great Greg Lake bellowing out "21st Century Schizoid Man" from "In the Court of the Crimson King" on "Power".

 As Nicki Minaj proclaims on one of her guest vocal spots "It's a mother fucking monster!". I'm not one to argue.
