### This is such a great snapshot of sleazy 80's English disco delivered effortlessly by a brilliantly deviant "chatty man" Marc Almond and electronic knob twiddler David Ball.  
  
While "Tainted Love" is the big hit from this album it's all of the other tracks that really stand out. "Sex Dwarf" is particularly sordid and "Chips On My Shoulder" is pure ear candy. There's not a weak track on the whole record.  
  
While Human League, Cabaret Voltaire and Heaven 17 were my go to bands of the time, this record has really survived the test of time. Perhaps it's the fact it doesn't take itself at all seriously.Â   
  
A real treasure of the time. [On vinyl of course!]
