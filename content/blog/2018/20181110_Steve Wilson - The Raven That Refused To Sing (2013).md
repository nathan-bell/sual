### One last spin before venturing to Auckland to see the Prog God in the flesh.

 This is my second Steven Wilson trip with my boy Pete. The last gig was an intimate gig at The Powerstation and it's well up there as[one of my top 3 gigs of all time](http://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/most-important-gigs/2017/4/16/davids-list-of-most-important-gigs).   
(If you look hard enough in the photo on my gigs list, that's me just left of the person in red on the balcony).   

 Whatever happens, it should be a great break away.
