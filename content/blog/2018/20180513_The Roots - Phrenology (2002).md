### It's a mixed bag for me this one. 

 Some of the more experimental stuff grates but then the record completely absolves itself with some incredibly hooky bass-lines and riffs and several songs to die for.   
  
I've collected quite a few Roots records over the years and they certainly bang to the beat of their own drum. While it doesn't always work, the stuff that does is truly captivating.
