### Just organising some tracks for tonight and thought I really needed to play a track from the wonderful Yo La Tengo.   
  
A husband and wife band, in this case comprising of Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley, just might earn me some extra points.  
  
I've also got another similarly configured band up my sleeve for a potential landslide of recognition. I'll show the bastards! 

 Going back to this album though, it really is a thing of great beauty and restraint.  I would only need to listen to the nearly 18 minute version of "Night Falls In Hoboken" to be completely satisfied. However, the other 12 tracks are equally engaging.
