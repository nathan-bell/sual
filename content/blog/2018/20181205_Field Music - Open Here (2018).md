### Another stunning release from Sunderland's Brewis brothers. Purchased from Marbecks on a recent Auckland excursion, this very vinyl-worthy long player is clearly made (on clear vinyl), for needle and groove.

 The rich, multi-layered orchestration and punchy production fills up every space of my room - there's no compression here my friends!

 At just under 37 minutes, it's over in no time at all. The epitome of "getting the job done".
