### I still haven't trawled through all of my $2 "take-a-punt" CDs from Te Whare Putunga.  After my Steven "Bloody" Wilson marathon last month, I'm ready for some fresh sounds.

 Cate Le Bon is from Wales and sounds like a slightly excited and upbeat Nico. This disc proves to be another absolute gem and hits the ground running from track one.  

 It's quirky, discordant but highly accessible and brim full of hooks. The Velvets meet Stereolab.

 Look out back catalogue Cate! Here I come.
