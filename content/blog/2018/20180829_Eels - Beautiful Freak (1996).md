### This was my first exposure to the eccentric world of Mark Oliver Everett (aka E) and it remains my favourite Eels record.  
  
I became aware of E's tragic childhood in his wonderful autobiography "Things The Grandchildren Should Know" which I read a decade on from when this record was first released.  
His tragic childhood and search for meaning is fully reflected in his introspective lyrics and poignant reflections on life. Musically and lyrically it's a truly engaging and absorbing journey.
