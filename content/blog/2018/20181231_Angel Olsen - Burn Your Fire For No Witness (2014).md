### I had absolutely no idea what I was going to play on this, the final day of 2018. I tried to be objective and choose something that's on my "best of" list.

 That didn't work, I'd have to exclude something - so best to avoid. Going random was by far the best option then. I did a grab then and chose this bit of virgin shiny plastic disc gifted to me by fellow Shut-Up-And-Listen(er) Chris.

 (For some reason this didn't hit the right spot for him - a bit like my "Jaco - OST" fail which is going straight into his collection).

 After a tentative, oh too country/folky vibe, it quickly trans-morphs into something really special.   
Chris, I LOVE this record!
