### Debut release from big boy Cambridge rockers. While it's not …… hideous, it's not something I'm likely to have on high rotation. I only parted with one coin for this.

While it's highly formulaic and intentionally anthemic, it is listenable - at least once!. There's some great, if somewhat predictable, chord progressions and nuances throughout but there's very little subtlety to escape the bombardment.

As I say, it's not unpleasant, just not very challenging.
