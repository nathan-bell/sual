### This is another recently discovered gem of an album on my Tidal play list. Another great road album that made my journey back from Goblin Bay not long enough.Â  I couldn't wait to get home and play this via Hi-Res streaming audio.  
  
Gaz Coombes was leader of Supergrass the now defunct and astoundingly great Brit-Pop band of the 90's and early 20's.

 Four solo albums in, his brilliance shows no sign of waning.
