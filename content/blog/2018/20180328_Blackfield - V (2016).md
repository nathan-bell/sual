### When I just want to be pounded by some melodic pomp that doesn't require much investment in meaningful listening I usually turn to the wonderful Blackfield.  
  
This is one of the side projects of my favourite musician/record re-master extraordinaire Steven Wilson and Israeli singer/songwriter Aviv Geffen.

 The production and quality of sound on this baby is eviscerating. There's some serious volume being pushed out by my big BMWs this evening. Sometimes you just need a blow out!Â
