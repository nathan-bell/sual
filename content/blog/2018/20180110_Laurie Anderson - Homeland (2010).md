### There's something rather comforting about Laurie Anderson. She's very much an "Emperor's New Clothes" protagonist.Â 

 While written following the big financial crisis of 2008, it just seems so relevant in today's bonkers world. While not scathing, she's simply reflecting on the less than united state of America.

 We need more Laurie Andersons.
