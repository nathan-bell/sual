### I'm at it again I'm afraid. I'm playing it safe and listening to [my goto band](http://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2018/4/2/blackfield-v-2016).  
  
One reason why I love this band is that includes possibly my most listened-to-artist of the last 10 years - Mr Steven Wilson.  
  
Those who eventually take notice and listen to this man, either through his solo work or via his many bands and collaborations, (Porcupine Tree, No-Man, Blackfield, Storm Corrosion), usually become obsessive and highly possessive.   
  
He's one of life's best kept secrets.  Not everyone is "SW-worthy" I'm afraid - you have to know what decent music sounds like for a start!
