While definitely sounding like it was made in the early 80's (it was!) this record is testament to good songwriting, not quirky, clever production (which it also has).   
  
It's an incredibly dark record lyrically, but that heavy load is mitigated by some of the poppiest and hookiest music imaginable.    
  
This is one terrific album.
