### I've always been really impressed with the the non-genre disclosure of this very clever English gentleman born to Ugandan refugee parents.

 On this, his third record, there's a mix of R&B, soul, folk and psychedelia all tinted with his open admonishment of the establishment.

 The album is named "Kiwanuka" as a protest against a suggestion that he might like to change his name to something more "marketable".

 I picked this up at Smithie's half-price record sale.
