### Mr Wilson's first "actual" solo album made at the peak of Porcupine Tree's popularity and critical acclaim. (For those who had actually heard of him and the band that is!).  
  
While much of it is still in the Porcupine Tree vein, with the brilliant Gavin Harrison remaining on drums, there's definitely a hint of where he's heading with future projects.
