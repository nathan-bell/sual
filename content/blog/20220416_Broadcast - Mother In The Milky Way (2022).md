### This 2009 EP was only ever available during the tour of that year. To say it's unconventional would be under selling it to say the least.

 This demands that you sit down and listen intently for its 20 minute duration and attempt to absorb in some meaningful way, just what's going on.

 You never will. And that's the beauty of it. For the ultimate experience, I'll be donning headphones for my next listen.
