 I took a big punt on this one during my weekly Warehouse bin trawl.   
   
Dropping from $49 to $29 and a couple of well known tracks, including the anthemic "Renagade Fighter", convinced me to part with my cash. And what a ripper it is!   
  
A dozen faultless tracks, including a few Kiwi classics, show why these dudes were the real deal.    
  
It's interesting to [read the adoration on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Silencer-Zed/dp/B00005J8W3) around the time of release.
