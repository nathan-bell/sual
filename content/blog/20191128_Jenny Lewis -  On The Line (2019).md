### I would have bought this wonderful record just for the cover alone. It's certainly a great (in stereo) representation of the pleasures within. (you might appreciate the larger than usual cover art).

 It's a bonus then that Jenny Lewis is such a great singer/songwriter and crafts a great, non-genre defining master work.  

 Picked up this lovely slab of blue, swirly vinyl in dreary old Hamilton. That dump therefore has a few redeeming features.
