### For me the last great Bowie record.   
  
It's abrasive and harder edged in places than "Low" but is similarly radical with it's mix of ambient textures. 

 Not all tracks work for me, the opening track "Beauty And The Beast" is an irritating mess, but "Sons Of The Silent Age" redeems things with one of Bowie's best ever vocal performances.

 I'm not sure what the switch was, but while there were fleeting moments with "Lodger" and "Scary Monsters" I'd moved on to other forms of sonic pleasure. 

 Punk and new wave ensured that I would not return easily. Bowie had really sold out by 1983's "Lets Dance" anyway.
