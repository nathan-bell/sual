### I've been listening to this wonderful EP on repeat via streaming services over the last couple of weeks.

 I just can't get enough of it. I managed to pick up a (very expensive) 45rpm vinyl copy the other day and I couldn't be happier.

 While it's an EP, it's a very generous one, just short of 30 minutes.

 It's epic, guitar driven, big country Americana rock delivered by Liverpool duo Craig Whittle and Hannah Merrick.

 The sultry voice of an angel enveloped by some of the bossiest guitar atmospherics this side of Will Sargeant's early Bunnymen days.

 I can't wait for their new, proper album to drop in the next few days.
