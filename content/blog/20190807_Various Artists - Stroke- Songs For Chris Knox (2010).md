### One of my greatest experiences ever!, was witnessing Chris Knox going completely beserk at The New Levin in the late late 70's. This was with his post The Enemy band Toy Love.

There's nothing quite like the intensity of Mr.Knox's stare as he spits his vitriol both literally and actually in ones face. (We were really close!)

As a social commentator over many years, he revealed himself as a real art, music and culture geek.
