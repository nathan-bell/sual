### This record is made for live performance.   
It's wall to wall fuzzy guitar and singin' sheilas. What's not to like?  
While side one is straight forward surf-infused bonkers, side two is where The Breeders meets The Cramps.  
  
Along with The Echo Ohs, one of my favourite NZ releases of the year.
