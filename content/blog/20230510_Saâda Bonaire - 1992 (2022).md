### This 2022 release, gathers together a bunch of 30 year old, dance-new wave fusion tracks from multi-cultural collective, Sa창da Bonaire, natives of Bremen, Germany. 

 Centred around two female vocalists, Stefanie Lange and Claudia Hossfeld, DJ Ralf Behrendt, brings it altogether with the help of dozens of local musicians culled from the local immigration centre.

 It's a crazy blend of dance, dub, African, and Middle Eastern music. While it never really caught on at the time it's now highly regarded, and a very catchy, cult classic.
