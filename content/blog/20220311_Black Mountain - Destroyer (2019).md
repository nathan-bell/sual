### When these Canadian Space Rock Psych Warriors put any record out, you know it's always a wall to wall riff fest.

 This is no exception. A major point of difference between these dudes and your stock-standard stoner bands, is Stephen McBean and Amber Webber's vocal antics, often call and response.

 OK it's not Nancy and Lee, but it's spectacularly effective. The guitar playing is equally tasty.

 The track "FD'72" is a fabulous way to end the record.
