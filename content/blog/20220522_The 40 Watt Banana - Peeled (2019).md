### The best ever Indo-Afro Psychedelic Jazz band in New Zealand, these recordings date from the late 60s, early 70s, with most of the tracks unreleased demos. Released by Spanish record company Pharaway Sounds, it is all class with an American style cover and heavy vinyl.

 The (apparently) cult classic tune, “Nirvana”, is mastered from the original tapes and sounds fab. The rest of the tracks are as far removed from contemporary New Zealand life, then and now, as possible.
