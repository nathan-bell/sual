### A timeless masterpiece from my favourite, post-punk/decommissioned new romantic front man, neo-reclusive avant-jazzasist.

 Surrounded by extraordinary musicians, Robert Fripp and Bill Nelson included, this remains genre resistant.

 Given it's foibles, it demands a fully focused, uninterrupted listen. 

 There's a lot of magic left in these old CDs.
