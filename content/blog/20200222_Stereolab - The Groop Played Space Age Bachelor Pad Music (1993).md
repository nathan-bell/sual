### There's more tambourine playing by Laetitia Sadier than actual singing on this record. Apparently she was sick and didn't get much studio time so the band just played on.   
  
It's all very experimental, with lots of Moog samples and even an air freshener in the mix. Split into two sides, there's an "Easy Listening" side and a "New Wave" side (which rocks!).   
  
It's not one of their most revered record but it's still an essential record in The Labs discography.
