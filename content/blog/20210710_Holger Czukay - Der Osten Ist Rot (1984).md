### Completely wacko but totally enjoyable forth solo record from co-founder of krautrock band Can.

 Aside from the first song, "The Photo Song", (definitely a false start as the "poppiest" song on the album), it's an unconventional and wild ride across the remaining 10 tracks.

 It won't be to everyone's liking but it's a little bit of magic to these ears.
