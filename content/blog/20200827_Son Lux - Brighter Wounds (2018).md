### I hate always playing it safe with music and this certainly takes me well out of my comfort zone.  And this record which I'm listening to for the first time since picking it out of a bargain bin, does so in such a welcome and refreshing way.    
  
If you can think of a more experimental than usual Anthony And The Johnsons sans any discernible time signature and throw in some completely over the top percussive elements and textures, you might come close.   
  
Just when you think there's some structure, that idea gets quickly quashed. But this is not a negative at all - it's a complete break from the conventional but still makes for a totally engaging and unpredictable listen.    
  
One of the reviews on Allmusic.com reads *"“Brighter Wounds” is a beautifully weird, melancholic mélange of manipulated sound that will creep under your skin and itch for a long time".*
