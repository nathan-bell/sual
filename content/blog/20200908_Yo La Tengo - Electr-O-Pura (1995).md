### Along with Low, Pavement and Stereolab, the Tengos have been nothing but consistently great.   
  
This record is a wonderful blend of early Velvets and post-Daydream Nation Sonic Youth.    
  
Part of the attraction for me, and also characteristic of Sonic Youth and Low, is the husband-wife vocals of Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley. There's undoubtedly chemistry between them but this hormonal blend also makes for a truly eclectic and varied experience throughout.
