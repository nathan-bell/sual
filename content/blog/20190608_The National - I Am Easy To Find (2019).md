### This is not a typical The National record. In fact, if you like The National, you may not like this record.

 It's a meandering beauty, with lots of female collaborators stripping away any testosterone-enduced muscularity that may have dominated previous records.

 I first heard about this record and previewed several tracks on a recent RNZ National's Music 101 podcast. My decision was therefore to go out and buy this sprawling 4-sided vinyl masterwork.
