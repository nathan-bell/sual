### Any album that includes a track with banjo, 11 piece Indian violin ensemble, sitar and Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval is alright by me.

 This collaborative record by UK collective DIV includes guest spots by Paul Weller, Liam Gallagher (who actually kicks arse!) and Mazzy Star amongst others.

 It's abrasive and mirky at times but waiting-for-a-train-wreck-to-happen mesmerising. Purchased for $4.98.
