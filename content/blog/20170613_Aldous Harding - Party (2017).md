### I accidentally discovered Aldous Harding via a co-appearance with Lorde on Jools Holland. The two kiwis both sang on the same night. (A first for ANY Kiwis)  
  
A brief mention and link to YouTube plucked my curiosity - this was someone I had never heard of.

 I was immediately mesmerised by a truly unique performance - singing "Horizon". Part actor, part singer, and accompanied by just a few simple piano chords, this was refreshingly atypical.   
  
I bought the LP without hesitation.  
  
Being a 4AD artist makes total sense. The record plays out like a new "This Mortal Coil" chapter. Fresh, quirky and totally original.
