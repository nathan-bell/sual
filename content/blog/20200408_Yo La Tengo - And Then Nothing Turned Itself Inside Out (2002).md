### Yo La Tengo is not a band you play often. When you do, it's an absolute revelation!   
  
No two listens are the same. To categorise would be sacrilege.   
  
They exist in their own time and space and sound like no other band on the planet. They were noisy once, now they aren't - so much. That's about all I can say except they wrap themselves around every synapse in my brain.
