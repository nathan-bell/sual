### On vinyl

 This is definitely hippy dippy stuff preceding Marc Bolan's glam days. I couldn't resist picking this up on vinyl today at TWH.

 I've never delved much into his back catalogue and its a bit unnerving to do so but a jolly fascinating journey. It's a richly diverse record with hints of greatness about to unfold. 

 Best track: Elemental Child
