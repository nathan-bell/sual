### Another souvenir from one of my bin diving adventures, this is a very interesting mix of musical genres. To actually determine what those genres are however, is a rather perplexing challenge.

 There's obvious hip hop/R&B/spoken word/industrial rock/electronica as the main ingredients and Trent Reznor as it's soft centre. Throw in some Radiohead crust and deep fry in some Frankie Goes To Hollywood. 

 It's a musical pot luck potpourri.
