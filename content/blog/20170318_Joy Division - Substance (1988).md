### An amazing compilation of singles and non-album tracks. Incidently, New Order released a compilation a year earlier also called ["Substance"](http://www.allmusic.com/album/substance-mw0000191190). While, that's probably a preferable way to listen to NO, this seems a far more relevant and comfortable listen.

 The stripped back nature of these tracks, un-embellished with electronics, makes them seem timeless. 

 Reading an article about the impending Sub-Alpine rupture while listening to this makes it sound even more menacing. Bleak but brilliant!
