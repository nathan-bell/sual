### What a mish mash of a record! And that's high praise indeed. The width and depth of this covid lockdown production by these obviously bored and highly prolific Australians is quite remarkable.

 This, by the way, is their 18th recording since 2012. There's definitely a proggy/hippy feel to general proceedings but there are numerous excursions along the way. There's even a Middle Eastern vide in there somewhere.  (For some records, including this one, they do apply microtonal tuning to their instruments which is a non-Western way of tuning that involves intervals smaller than a semitone).

 I'll be searching out a few more of their records as we head to Melbourne, the birthplace of this ensemble.
