 Led "Folking" Zeppelin.  
  
After hearing Fairport Convention's "Reynardine" the other night at our monthly "Shut Up and Listen" session, I was struck by the Led Zeppelinesqueness (yes it really is a word - google it!!) of said track.  
  
"Rising" by Sarah Beth Tucek also had a Plant/Page feel to proceedings. It was a WTF moment!  
  
A big "Jimmy Page" biography also hung indiscreetly in a book shelf nearby. What the fuck's going on?  
  
"Over The Hills And Far Away" is now playing - time to sling your hook, "The Crunge" is coming!!!!!.  
  
ONLY ON VINYL.
