### Today I read something about the band Sleeper reforming for a new album so thought I'd do a recap of their debut.

 This particular recording benefits greatly when listened to at a good volume - otherwise it's a bit lacking in dynamics. (This seems to be typical of many late 80's/mid 90's recordings?)

 Good, riffy songs that don't outstay their welcome. Louise Wener is not gifted with the most powerful voice on the planet but it's not unpleasant.
