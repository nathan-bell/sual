### It's obvious I'm not meant to be digging this band!  
  
First, their support slot with Tame Impala is now a non-event even if Mr. Parker makes it to these shores for his rescheduled concert in early December. It's unlikely that will go ahead as well.   
  
Two, this record, originally purchased on beautiful pink vinyl is delayed by several weeks AND now only available on black.   
  
Three, this vinyl has a distinct warp.  But hey, luckily it plays ok. It's still a bit annoying.   
  
Despite all of that grief, (no one else suffers like I do!), it sounds absolutely fantastic.    
  
There's more barely-there vocals and upfront bass playing from Laura Lee and THAT brilliant meandering psychedelic tone from Mark Speer compliments proceedings beautifully. Then you have the worlds most chilled out drummer on the planet Donald Johnson Jr, just gluing things together.   
  
Well worth the wait.
