### This, PiL's 2nd outing, is equal parts atrocious and astounding. It's also possibly one of the most challenging and divisive records in my entire collection.

 It was also a record extremely influential in guiding the post-punk, new wave bands (at least the more interesting ones) that emerged from the late 70's, early 80's. 

 I was never a fan at the time but after reading John Lydon's autobiography "Anger Is An Energy" I am retrospectively discovering some hidden PiL treasures.  It's not always easy listening but there are some genuine OMG! moments.
