### This is a lovely, hazy trip back to the late 60's American West Coast except this band hails from 21st Century Denmark.   
  
There's nothing digital about this recording except the transport method used to get the sound to my stereo system. (This is absolutely tailor-made for vinyl!!)   
  
They have completely nailed the sound - wild stereo separation, fuzzy guitars, big valves and even the California twang.   
  
This record just leaves a great big smile on my face.
