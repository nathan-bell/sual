### I’ve finally got my space/place back where I can listen to the weird shit. With my grandkids now safely back in Australia, some semblance of order or disorder returns. While I love them to bits, seeing less of them does not diminish that affection. OK, this record is not so weird but would quickly be defined as such for those with less exposure to the non-mainstream.

 This now defunct Tokyo group mix up the pot with elements of jazz, prog, space rock and pastoral folk music. 

 Side two ramps’ things up to another level.
