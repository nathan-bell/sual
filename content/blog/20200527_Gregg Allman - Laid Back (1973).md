### I think my life is now complete!   
  
I now have this absolute peach of a record on beautifully remastered and totally rejuvenated pitch black vinyl.   
  
And it has never sounded so good to theses ears.  There’s definitely the sense of the veil being removed and the pipes getting a clean out. There’s more bongos on this and the sweeping organ and piano sounds are exquisite. And that voice is just incredible.  And no, while some remasters are guilty, it’s not just louder.   
  
Hey, you don’t mess up a good thing!     
  
One of my top ten records comes home. Thanks big sis - 1973 was a great year!
