### My first encounter with XTC was this record.

 Aside from the truly iconic cover that grabbed my attention, it was this record that helped me to move from listening to the marginally talented punk/post-punk bands to proper musicians that took risks.

 Astoundingly clever, Mr. Partridge and company would never let up in the brilliance department including and following this gem. T-Shirt and Vinyl-worthy.
