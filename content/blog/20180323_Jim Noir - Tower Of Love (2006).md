### A brilliant $2 bin trawl item that is now a highly regarded musical artifact in my collection of other musical artifacts. It's very obvious to me that I don't play this gem nearly enough.  
  
Very much in the slightly wacky and infectiously melodic universe occupied by The Super Furry Animals. (I'm a bit annoyed by this realisation - [allmusic.com thinks exactly the same](https://www.allmusic.com/album/tower-of-love-mw0000575587)).Â   
  
Jim Noir (born Alan Roberts) is a very clever gentleman from Davyhulme in Manchester who has more talent in his foreskin (a bit of an assumption there!) than both of the Gallagher brothers put together.

 One of my favourite and best "finds". Ever!!
