### Remember this day! It's up there with JFK's assassination and the death of Lady Diana. But in my world, undoubtedly, more significant.  
  
Mark E Smith, who died today, was a one of my heroes. We even named our dog Brix after his ex-wife, Brixie Smith, who was once guitarist and chief tune-smith (pun absolutely intentional!).   
  
He was a totally screwed up, sad bastard but a pioneer and innovator who didn't give a tinker's curse what other people thought. His mantra was always repetition, repetition, repetition and his music a riff-based, free form vocal cacophony.

 RIP Mr. Mark E Smith.
