### Another trawl through the bins at Richmond's big red shed has again delivered a great return on investment for my time, patience and perseverance. I picked up another great stash of 6 or so CDs for under $20.  
  
This forth album by New York's Yeah Yeah Yeahs is one I've been eyeing up for a while but never got around to buying. (I've definitely become a very stingy bastard unless I'm buying vinyl. I think it's the permanence of vinyl that makes the idea of "owning it" so endearing).

 Anyhows, like all of YYYs records - no one screams it quite like Karen O. It's a bit mellower than their usual, but at times still brilliantly abrasive. Its a great and worthy addition to my collection.
