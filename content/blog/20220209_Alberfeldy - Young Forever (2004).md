### This CD sits right at the very top of my collection. OK, alphabetically it's a given, but musically it's simply an embarrassment of riches.

 While it has a Belle and Sabastian twee-ness feel to it, it has hooks and melodies to die for. 

 While all of those hateful fuckwits do the zombie dance, put this gem on, sit back and love the other 99%.   
Guaranteed feel good magic.
