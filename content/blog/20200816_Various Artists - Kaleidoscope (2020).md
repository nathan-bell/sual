### Along with [ACE Records](https://acerecords.co.uk/), [Soul Jazz Records](https://soundsoftheuniverse.com/sjr) out of Soho in London is my favorite record label for delivering stunning "new" music.   
  
When I say "new" - it's stuff I've never been exposed to and could very well be decades old. It's highly likely I never would never had heard this stuff without these wonderful compilations.   
  
This triple vinyl (+ 7" single) is brim full of contemporary and experimental British Jazz. I use the word "Jazz" very loosely as this would appeal to any music lover. The songs are long, without over staying there welcome and there's more than a few, moments of revelation and elation. "Jazz Club!"
