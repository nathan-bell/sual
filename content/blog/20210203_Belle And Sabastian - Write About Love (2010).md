### This record is the perfect musical accompaniment to a lovely warm and sunny summer evening.

 While it's all just a bit too immaculate for anyone's liking if you dig too deep, but as a listening experience it is pure ear candy.

 Originally jingle makers, B&S were quickly embraced by a bunch of arrant followers.

 Newly re-released on vinyl, this Scottish combo are zone-locked in some perfect musical and ageless moment in time.
