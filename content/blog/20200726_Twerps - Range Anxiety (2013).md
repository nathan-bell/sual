### Another awesome Aussie album. This gets an AAAA+ in anyone’s book.   
  
Earlier this month I did a bit of a rave about The Stroppies “Whoosh!” which is right up there as one of my finds of the year.   
  
One of the members of that band, Alex McFarlane, was also central to this band.   
  
There’s a definite Flying Nun/Pavement vibe to this record but not to the point of plagiarism.  Just a band with superb taste, invention and equally great execution.
