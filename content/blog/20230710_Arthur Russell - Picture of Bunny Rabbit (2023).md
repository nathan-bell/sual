### (code only faster: crossing the line from vocal to instrumental and back)

 This posthumous release from Arthur Russell, who died in 1992, is certainly not the place to start your musical journey through his back catalogue.

 This is some of his more avant guarde and inaccessible material he recorded during sessions for "World of Echo". 

 If you want to offend most reasonable and rational human beings, even those with a hint of broadmindedness, then throw this on and see what happens.

 If you truly embrace the diversity and width of musical genius and can see past the lack of structure and discernable melody, this can be life altering.
