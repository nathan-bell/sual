### Coming up to it's second decade, this incendiary debut album from London-based Quartet, Bloc Party, is refreshingly "rock".

 No fancy keyboards or unnessecary embellishments, this is just a slam of guitars, bass and drums and some vitriolic vocals from Kele Okereke. 

 One thing that really stands out is the massive drum sound of Matt Tong.  

 The world didn't need another Coldplay or U2, thank god they were influenced by Suede, The Pixies and Mogwai.
