### **Live:    The Black Angels/Black Mountain - 07/10/2010 - Shepherd's Bush Empire, London**

 A wonderful "two-fer-one" at one of the planets best rock venues, these two great stoner groups really stirred up the big Psych pot.

 While the highlight was definitely Black Mountain, The Black Angels set the scene with some big hair 70's dirge and hippy trippy fuzz. Riff-tastic.

 The Mountain men then delivered an even more stoner, quitar squalling mind fuck of a gig. Black Sabbath meets Pink Floyd.

 This record, the Angels debut, is a brilliant reminder of a special night.
