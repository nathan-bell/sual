### This sprawling, hooks-heavy third release from the Haim sisters is also sonically magnificent. 

 As with the first two vinyl releases it's mastered at 45rpm. It's really noticeable how good vinyl sounds at this speed. The only downside is you need to get up a bit more to change sides.

 Getting this back on the turntable as quickly as possible is a real pleasure. This record is right up there with the real classics.
