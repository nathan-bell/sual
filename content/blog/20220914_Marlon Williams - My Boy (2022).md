### A courier package arrived from Flying Out Records this afternoon. In that package was a compact disc (aka CD).

 This also happened to be a brand-new release from the undisputed boy with the silkiest voice in Godzone.

 I was also 100% sure it was a record that would fully engage the whole household. I played it in the lounge downstairs, and I was not wrong.

 There was an immediate demand for tickets to see him live.
