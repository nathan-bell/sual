### This couldn't be further along the other end of the continuum than yesterday's outing with Analogue Africa. It’s probably as close to Ambient as I want to get but has an underlying grime to proceedings.

 There’s some great bottom end so it's not advisable to push the volume too much a la Boom Boom DK! Ideal for an evening session.

 A nice no brainer though.
