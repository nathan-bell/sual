### One of several vinyl purchases picked up over Easter Weekend in Wellington was this little gem from New York duo Merrill Garbus and Nate Brenner.

 I took a bit of a punt on this and relied on reputation without any prior listening to previous albums (this is their fifth). I needn't have worried - it's pure, but oh so quirky, ear candy.

 Back catalogue here I come.
