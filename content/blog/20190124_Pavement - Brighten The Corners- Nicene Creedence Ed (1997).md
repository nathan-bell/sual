### Ane of my favourite musical adventures was seeing Pavement in the flesh at The Caledonian Hall, in Christchurch on Wednesday 13th July 1994. 

It was sloppy, it was loud, it was life affirming. They split in 1999 and made 5 exceptional records including this one. Stephen Malkmus is still making amazing records.

In 2002 he covered the song ["Death And The Maiden"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-GqgN00Kr0) by The Verlaines. 

I happened to meet an ex Verlaine the other day. Mike, his real name, was once a bass player in The Verlaines. He is now a security specialist. It made my day.
