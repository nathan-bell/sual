### Merseysideâ€™s, The Coral have never made a duff record in all of their 20 plus years of existent.

 This new record is another album filled to the brim with greatness. It's retro-rock for sure but that's always been their schtick.

 This double record is beautifully packaged. Part 1, sides A and B, "Welcome To Coral Island" is party time, it's the holiday season.

 Part 2, taking up sides C and D, "The Ghost Of Coral Island" is more introspective, dealing with a place bereft of life during the off season.

 Very apt for these times I suppose.
