### It's taken a few days to recover from our latest "Shut Up And Listen" session. I have been bereft of enthusiasm following an at times mind-warping journey through seven unique musical showcases of iconic musicians.  
  
Those musicians were: Jimmy Page, Scott Walker, Tom Waits, Steven Wilson, Nels Cline, Cowboy Junkies and John Martyn.    
  
It was a long, but very satisfying trip that had the impact of satiating any desire for further musical explorations since. Today it was time to get back on the saddle.  
  
Bill Nelson could very well have been on that list of clever bastards, he's a phenomenal guitar player and song writer and this is aptly demonstrated throughout this wonderful live album from 1977.  However, his later experimentation, is probably best left in the laboratory. He ain't no Scott Walker!   
  
Bill Nelson did leave a great legacy however as one of the godfathers of new wave.
