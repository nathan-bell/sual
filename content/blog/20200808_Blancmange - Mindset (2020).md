### It seems like Blancmange have been around for donks! I've been listening to these poppy knob twiddlers since the very early 80's.   
  
In hindsight and with a little bit of fact-checking research it seems that they split in 1986 and reformed in 2011 when Neil Arthur took over the name and starting recording solo.    
  
It still sounds like it could have been recorded back in 1982 but with bigger production and fatter synths. Every song is trademark Blancmange and is as comforting as a great big wobbly pudding.
