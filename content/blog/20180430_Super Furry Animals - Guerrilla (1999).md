### Another big bonkers record from the Super Furry's. This, their 3rd record, is as good as any in their catalogue. They simply do not know how to make a dud record.  
  
I could actually say quite confidently that every record they make is better than every other record they make.Â 

 "Chewing Chewing Gum" is the second best song I've ever heard about the dangers of masticating chuddy. Possibly only bettered by the great Lonnie Donegan's "Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour On the Bedpost Overnight"
