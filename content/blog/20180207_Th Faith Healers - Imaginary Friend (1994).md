### Another messy, lower than lo-fi chunk of American noise/Krautrock from London's Hamstead. WTF, I always assumed they were American!

 After some fact checking I found out they were actually part of the Camden lurch scene of the early to mid 90's. Apparently "lurch" refers to a dance motion that's been described as a movement not dissimilar to the action taken prior to throwing up. 

 Any way, this record doesn't make me feel like throwing up, it's just a great little CD I recently knew nothing about.
