### This is another example of not being risk adverse when choosing new music. This is just brilliant and being brave has given me the biggest buzz in donks.

 (interpreted: I have absolutely no regrets buying this record despite not knowing anything about this band and relying on my vinyl broker thrusting it into my hands and saying "you MUST own this!")

 Think Slint/The For Carnation crossed with Lamb Chop and Nick Cave. Clearly a front runner for the find of the year.
