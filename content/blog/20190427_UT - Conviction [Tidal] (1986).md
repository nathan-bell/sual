### I’ve made a pact with myself to listen to a brand new new release or brand new old album (or whatever you call a collection of songs by a single artist or curator these days?) at least three times a week. There’s so much great music literally at arm’s reach. 

 I now have both Tidal and YouTube Music on tap so there is a universe to keep exploring. 

 This 1986 record re-released and given the remastering treatment, is the first studio album from the all female NYC trio UT. They sound like all of my favourite bands of the time wrapped into one. A fantastic discovery!
