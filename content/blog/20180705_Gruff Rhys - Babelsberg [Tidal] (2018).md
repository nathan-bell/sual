### Absolutely brilliant solo album lovingly crafted by the Super Furry Animals frontman.  
  
I listened to this yesterday on my journey back from Golden Bay. It made the trip far too short.  
I would have happily travelled there and back again simply to listen to this gem a couple of more times.  
  
On hi-res audio via Tidal it is a stunning thing to behold. Without hesitation this is one of the best things I've heard this year.
