### Threw a random "C" this evening. Too hot to think about objectively choosing something to listen to. This will do quite nicely thank you. The Coral hail from Liverpool and live in a 60's musical time warp.  
   
The approach to recording also lends itself to that era with faux stereo separation, ultra twangy guitars and big croony vocals.  
Nice!
