### I’ll be honest, I’m really not sure if I like this or not? As I’ve always proclaimed I’m not really a lyrics man. While there are great songs throughout, and the production is stunning, sometimes I’d wish he’d just shut the fuck up!  
  
That’s probably a good reason why I’ve never been a Springsteen fan - play me some tunes, the rest is just unnecessary noise.  
  
As I get further in however, it is starting to win me over. In fact I’ll take it all back. But don’t get excited, it’s still a voice-as-instrument moment.
