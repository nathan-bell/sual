### While there were a few fleeting moments sans John Foxx, with Ultravox version 2.0, which followed on after his departure, the original Ultravox was more of a real deal.

 "Vienna" was a huge hit for Ultravox MkII but was contrived, formulaic and manufactured for the New Romantics tranche and subsequent new wave oblivion.

 "Ultravox", their first record, with John Foxx at the helm, is one of my desert Island discs. 

 This compilation is a slightly unusual amalgam of his more accessible, psychedelic-tinged tracks. Certainly not mainstream by any stretch but essential in my world.
