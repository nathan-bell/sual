### Another fabulous example of late 70s New York No Wave that's further perpetrated by French invader Lizzy Mercier Descloux.

 Take some of Serge Gainsbourg's Afrobeat, combine with Blondie's disco-inflected punk and Talking Heads' world music-inspired art pop and you get the drift.

 There's some excellent reinterpretations of several well known songs including Arthur Brown's "Fire", "The Theme from Mission Impossible" and "Fever" (sung as "Tumour").

 Brilliant!
