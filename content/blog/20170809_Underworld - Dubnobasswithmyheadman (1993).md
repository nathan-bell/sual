### A major major discovery for me in the early 90's, Underworld was a serious electronic rock band. Dubnobasswithmyheadman remains an absolute classic record.

 I picked up this revitalised deluxe version from TWH for $8. It just sounds even more fantastic! Crisp and punchy and still like nothing else.

 Best known for the wonderful "Born Slippy" track from the film "Trainspotting" - Underworld were and still are beyond cool.
