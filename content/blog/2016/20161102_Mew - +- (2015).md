### You always know what you are getting with Mew. More beautiful, rich and melodious anthems that soar with multilayer voice(s) to the fore.

 I just love the timber and tone of the Scandanavian and Icelandic voices - in this case it's Jonas Bjerre from Denmark.Â 

 Like everything that Mew does, this just gives me fucking goosebumps!!

 **Best Track: Making Friends.**
