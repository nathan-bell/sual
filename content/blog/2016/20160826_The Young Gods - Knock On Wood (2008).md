### DVD

 For The Young Gods to make an all acoustic live record is like Nana Mouskouri going death metal. But hey, it works a treat.

 This DVD is a fantastic record of reinterpreted songs from across their entire catalogue.  
Not able to hide behind their usual samplers, keyboards and electronics, they are revealed as genuinely accomplished and conventional musicians. 

 There's still plenty of intensity however so don't be expecting a Nana gig. 

 Their version of Hendrix's "If Six Was Nine" with Erika Stucky on vocals and First Sony is a real treat.
