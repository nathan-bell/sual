### **On Vinyl**

 More 70's magic. Kraftwerk was so important to me at around the late 70's early 80's.  While "Computer World" did the miles on my walkman, this beauty helped me usher in Bowie's Berlin period. The cold, stark reality of this place and time is all the more poignant in this confused European travelogue. 

 **Repetition, repetition, repetition!!!**
