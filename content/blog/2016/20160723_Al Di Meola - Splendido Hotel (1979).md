### It was Al's birthday yesterday so thought I'd get into some Di Meola magic this afternoon.  
While this recording shows it's age (the keyboards especially sound dated) it's still a great record to show off his versatility. While not soulful like Carlos he's still a maestro and superb technician. I especially like his acoustic playing and would trade this any day for his manic runs along the fretboard.
