### **45 rpm 12 inch Vinyl**

 I first played this great big double slab of 12 inch 45rpm vinyl at 33rpm a while back (it sounded like Low hitting the sludge button) and it lasted all of 5 minutes before I realised.  
Setting up the record player just felt like too much effort so I didn't bother.

 Here's a chance to listen to it in all of it's glory and it was definitely worth the wait!Â 

 A no frills, QOTSA album. Meant to be played loud and on the highest quality chunk of plastic in my collection.
