### Brilliant second outing for this London born Ugandan. I saw a lot of references to this while in London, so had to bring this home.

 The 10 minute opening track sets the scene and is worth the asking price alone. The fact that all tracks have similar qualities makes this record exceptional.

 Contender for record of the year.
