### Heard this beast of a record while shopping at Rough Trade. I was fully engaged with it playing throughout the store. I just had to have a copy.

How one categories this racket is not the challenge - actually getting through a listening session unscathed is more of a worry. It gets into your cranium and doesn't let go.

Iggy, Jim and Syd meets Timothy Leary and William Burroughs. Totally uncompromising and cerebral.
