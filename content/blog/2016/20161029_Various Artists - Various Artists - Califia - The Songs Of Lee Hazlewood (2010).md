### Brilliant compilation of obscure (mostly) 50's and 60's artists recording Hazlewood songs. Just as the title implies.

Like all things "Hazlewood" there's a real coolness factor and a wealth of hit's and misses. However, the real highlights for me are always Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood or Lee Hazlewood in combination with any other female vocalist - trained or otherwise.

I'm trawling through his back catalogue and loving everything he touches.
