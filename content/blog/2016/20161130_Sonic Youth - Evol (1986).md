### This album was probably the starting point for me when music shifted from an Anglo-centric template (The Smiths, The Cure, The Bunnymen) to a much richer and wider aural palate and gave me a greater appreciation of American bands.

 This discordant gem certainly got me out of my English rut and I have never looked back.

 Their Wellington gig (01/08/96 Wellington Town Hall) could quite possibly be the greatest musical "event" of my life.
