### Vinyl

 Saw this at TWH for only 6 bucks more than the CD - so couldn't resist.

 Sometimes its hard to understand why something as well packaged as this, gatefold and poster included, could be considerably cheaper than the latest Pink Floyd vinyl remasters. "Ummagumma" for god sake is close to $70!!

 I'd read various scathing reviews of this and was a bit reluctant. On first listen I can understand the concerns - it definitely deviates from Polly's usual template. It may need a few more listens and a look at her Glastonbury set to assimilate.Â
