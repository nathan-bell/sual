### This is just an earthy, no frills, 3 piece (including the legendary Steve Albini) making another great racket. Probably the antithesis of the previous Grouplove session.

 This reminds me a lot of Big Black's "Songs About Fucking" which is one of my favs from way back. Not everyone's cup of tea but hitting the sweet spot this evening.
