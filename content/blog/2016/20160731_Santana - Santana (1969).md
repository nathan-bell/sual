### **Vinyl**

 This recently remastered vinyl record album had my jaw dropping and hitting the floor.

 Another album I remember from my sister's collection sounding absolutely stunning on vinyl.  
While Carlos Santana is a remarkable guitar player this is also a real showcase of the band's fantastic musicianship.
