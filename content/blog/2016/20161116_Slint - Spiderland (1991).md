### It's that time of the year to bring this beauty out.

 What a fucking bonkers week!! Earthquakes, storms, floods (all predicted by Brian Tamaki by the way) and the further indignity of work!

 This is the perfect pressure cooker release valve. A desert Island disc if ever there was one. My goto record for a mood elevator and head clean.
