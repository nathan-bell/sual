### I heard a great interview on my commute to work this morning - a 40 minute cycle ride completely zoned out courtesy of [episode 755 of Marc Maron's WTF podcast](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-755-roger-waters).

 Marc Maron was interviewing Roger Waters. Brilliantly articulated, it was an incredibly revealling interview. He certainly didn't hold back on anything. Well worth a listen. 

 I was exposed to Meddle at an early stage in my musical upbringing and it remains a significant milestone in my listening experience. It's possibly the first airing it's had for a couple of decades.
