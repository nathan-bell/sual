### John Foxx has been making brilliantly retro, analogue music since he fronted the first incantation of Ultravox back in the late 70's. 

I've been a fan since those days and while his music hasn't evolved much - it hasn't needed to.

This sounds more relevant and contempory now than it ever did. It's stark, trance-like monotony is hypnotic. Welcome to the machine.
