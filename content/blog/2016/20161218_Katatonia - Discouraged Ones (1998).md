### Also picked this up cheaply (on heavy vinyl) during a smash and grab run at TWH. These Doom Metallers from Sweden went all Opeth and lost the growly vocals. (In hindsight however, I think these guys actually did it first!)

 This works as a rather brooding and epic progressive metal masterwork sprawled over 4 sides of vinyl.

 Despite not knowing much about this band when I bought this, I'm really liking what I hear.  
I Bought another one of theirs at the same time - 2013's Dethroned and Uncrowned.
