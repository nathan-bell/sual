### Very rowdy and abrasive (in small measures), exquisitely delicate and engaging (in bigger measures) and left field (completely). This is 1980 folks.

 The Associates first three records are some of my favourite relics from this awkward era. Bowie had left the building by then (ending with his last great record 1980's "Scary Monsters") and punk and new new wave had imploded.

 Billy Mackenzie came along and completely out-Bowie'd Bowie! A fantastic talent with a four octave range he died far too young in 1997.
