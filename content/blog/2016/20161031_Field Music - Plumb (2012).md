### This is one busy record. Always up there on my "should not be obscure" list, Field Music deliver truly dynamic, tempo changing, complicated but catchy pop music.

 This particular record, their forth, is all over in a flash (35 minutes) - so I thought I'd just play it again. Far from boring, it's XTC meets Prog.

 Fantastic!!
