### On newly minted, 2016 remastered 180g VinylÂ 

 While not exactly something I bought back from London (I was going to but saw it was cheaper in NZ so I didn't). Rushed out a bought today instead.

 This is undoubtedly in my top 10 records of all time. So many bands would sound crap if they hadn't been influenced by this. An absolute timeless masterpiece sounding even better on 2016 remastered vinyl.
