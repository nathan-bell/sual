### After a day of hearing the "I'm so busy" chant at work (ah diddums!) it's time for a blow out. 

 Tool live is one of the greatest rock events I have ever experienced.   
Wellington 2002 ([with The Melvins opening!!!!!](http://offthetracks.co.nz/it-was-the-best-gig-ever-8-melvins-opening-for-tool-wellington-2002/)) and Auckland 2011 [at The BDO](http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/tool/2011/mount-smart-stadium-auckland-new-zealand-53d2dbc1.html). Both absolutely astounding!

 This rarity (to purchase in this format anyway) is a fantastic CD/DVD package. Live and studio odds and sods and four tooltastic videos.

 I can't turn it up too loud as the last time I play Tool's "Aenima" loud I had complaitns from my pre-Kettley neighbours.
