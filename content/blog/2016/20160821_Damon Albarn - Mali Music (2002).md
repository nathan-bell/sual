**Damon Albarn/Afel Bocoum/Toumani Diabat√©/Mali Music**

Brilliant collaboration beween Damon Albarn (leader of Blur who I listened to the other day) and several Malian Muscisians.

Most of it is "found" recordings with additional studio enhancements. While far from sounding "live" Albarn lets it breathe without too much interference.

A superb and enchanting record.
