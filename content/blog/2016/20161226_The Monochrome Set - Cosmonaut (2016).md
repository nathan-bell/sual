### Another record from my London haul, this vinyl/CD combo harks back to a familiar sound I first encountered and thought had ended in the early to mid 80's. 

 While not quite as quirky, this re-formed band (in 2010) is most definitely a welcome return.

 One of my favourite records of that era was "Volume, Contrast, Brilliance" on Cheery Red records. Many tracks from this 2016 release could easily have come from those sessions.

 I was prepared to be utterly and completely disappointed. On first listen this couldn't be further from the truth.
