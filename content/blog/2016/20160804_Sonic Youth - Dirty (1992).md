### The two live Sonic Youth shows I went to in Wellington in 1995 (with the Foo Fighters) and Auckland in 2004 (with J.Mascis) are two of the most memorable events I have ever experienced.

 Whenever I hear a Sonic Youth record these days, those memories just come flooding back. Â They are still the point of difference I use as a benchmark to measure other bands and musicians with. I'm not sure if anyone comes even close!

 A great big discordant mess of a band - Brilliant!!
