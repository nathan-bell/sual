### As with all of the Beta Band releases, Steve Mason's song writing and mastery of the pop hook continues. This is a meandering beauty that just creeps along dragging you along with it.

 More sugar coated than flashy, it's multilayered instruments bereft of anything showy. In places there's definitely an early Floyd feel to proceedings and I could swear it's a young David Gilmour singing. Â 

 Could be on the deck a lot this summer.

 **Best track(s): Hardly Go Through, Words In My Head**
