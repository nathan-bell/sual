### One of my guilty pleasures is still liking some early Elton John records. 

 While this is possibly my favourite Elton John record, for numerous and quite frankly unexplainable reasons, this is definitely the end of the line as far as my E.J tolerance goes.   
It's simply amazing what he and Bernie produced in the years preceding this little rocker. Thank god Glam and Punk came along soon after this - my musical interests may have stagnated completely.

 Elton was a very important part of my musical upbringing and I am grateful I was exposed to this.  
His gig at Athletic Park in 1984 was one of the best concerts I've experienced. Three hours plus of complete and utter brilliance. (At the time!)
