### On pink vinyl.

 I can honestly say that no one makes music quite like Polica. It is however, a band that gets right inside my brain and like any mind altering phenomena, I just want more but I'm not sure why?!  
Endless tempo changes, strange ryhyms, indeciferable, pitch shifted lady vocals, twin drummers on pink vinyl. It all makes perfect sense to me.
