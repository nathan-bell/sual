### **CD 1**

 It might be a month of trawling through some compilations and see where that takes me. (There might be a few lapses here and there as I'm easily side-tracked.

 This stonker of a set was picked up at TWH for a ridiculous price. It's a fantastic compilation covering the years 1967 through to 2005. CD starts with his time with John Mayall and early Fleetwood Mac. Great re-production of some early classics - what a start! 

 **Best track: Drifting**
