### On Vinyl of course!

 I have a much greater appreciation of The Allman Bros and am actively seeking out all I can find. This is a fantastic place to start. This big fat slab of newly pressed and improved 180g vinyl is testament to their genius.  Another album that should be exclusively on vinyl.

 You can see, hear and touch the magic!
