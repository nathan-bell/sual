### Jamie Smith (XX) and his main collective The XX, are very hard to define musically. Despite borrowing from many different sources they still seem to be bereft of any definable genre. Iâ€™m not sure that matters however.

 On the first XX record they are as close to The Cure's dirgy vibe than any other band I've heard but sound completely different.

 This solo record my Mr XX is nothing like the XX but just the same.
