### The opening slide guitar on "Even Less", the first moment on this record, completely does me in. It's pure wall to wall class from then on.  
  
This fantastic live radio broadcast session recorded in Poland is living testament to the greatness of the Porcupine Tree live experience.  
  
How these guys remained under the radar is beyond me. When I listen to this stuff that's it. Any hope of multitasking completely goes out the window.
