### I didn't always "get" Jason Peirce's Spiritualized or Spacemen 3 back in the 80's and 90's. It just seemed so last century!   
  
These days, I am making up for lost time and finally appreciating these hypnotic, fuzzed-out, masterpieces.    
  
Don’t forget to put the cat out before hooking into the last 17 minute track "Cop Shoot Cop..."  You’ll forget where you are.
