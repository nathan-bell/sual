### This wasn't the starting place for me, that was 1981's "Tin Drum", but retrospectively the hint of Japan's sophistication emerges on this transitional record.

 The vocal snarl has gone and Mick Karn's incredible bass playing starts to assert itself. "Despair" could be a missing track off side two of Bowie's "Heroes" and David Sylvian's faux Brian Ferry was all over this record. 

 That was not bad imitation, it matched the fantastic musicianship of Richard Barbieri, Steve Jansen, Mick Karn and Rob Dean perfectly. There was no looking back.
