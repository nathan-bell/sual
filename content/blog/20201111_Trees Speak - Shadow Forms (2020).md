### Even though the world has gone completely bonkers, this sounds perfectly out of place and refreshingly unhinged.

 Heavily influenced by Krautrock, "Bitches Brew" Mile Davis and spooky soundtrack music for non-existent horror movies, it's a bit disconcerting to say the least.

 There's no vocals aside from a few "found" recordings and spooky wailing on side two. Don't listen to it in the dark, it might haunt your dreams.

 Crazy good.
