### An awesome compilation of music from "the post-psychedelic, pre-progressive moment" - hello 70's, goodbye 60's.

 I heard this playing at "Slow Boat" in Wellington a few months back - specifically Australian Daevid Allen of Gong fame performing a trance-like " Wise Man In Your Heart".  
I was hooked by this one song.  
  
Thankfully the rest of the record is just a engaging.Â
