### There's nothing much I can say about this record that wouldn't demean it's importance in my musical world. 

 While every track, aside from the rollicking "Doubt" is the epitome of understatement and restraint, it's the final track "Faith" that will take pride of place in my funeral march or on my death bed (I'm not really one for ceremony). 

 When I'm feeling pissed off, down, misunderstood or angry at the stupid big boss people in this world, I choose "faith" as catharsis.
