### It's Friday night - it's sonics over substance tonight. These Swiss electro-noise terrorists totally anilate all the rule books and smash you around the head with some of the heftiest beats and riffs imaginable.

 It's barely tolerable at times but totally invigorating. It's not a relaxing listen but it will leave you feeling totally drained. Job done then!
