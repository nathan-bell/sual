### As explained last month, My Computer's second album "No CV" is way way up there as one of my greatest discoveries. This record is close behind (or even Stephen if we really must rate it).

 This is simply jam packed with the most inventive and genre-jumping music to ever grace a single album. Finally tracked down in non-physical format, it sounds impossible. I still need this!
