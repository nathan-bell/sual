### There's simply no denying that this record is a true masterpiece. I'm not a Queen fan by any means but this is without question one of the high points of the 70's.

 I'm not sure where I was but I do remember hearing/seeing Bohemian Rhapsody for the first time (on a TV screen) and it was beyond words. Simply jaw-droopingly different from anything I ever experienced at the time.

 Listening to it now - it remains unmatched for sheer audacity and responsible for breaching the boundaries of rock.
