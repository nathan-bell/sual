### This band couldn't make a bad album if they tried.    
  
Over nearly 30 years, and since 1992's revelatory "May I Sing With Me", I have been totally absorbed by their unique and consistently brilliant musical journey.   
  
This, their latest record, really pokes the stick into the belly of the more accessible and sunny side of mid-sixties Velvet's.   
  
While there's hardly a riot going on here - it is another fine and essential record from this band of merry Hobokenians.
