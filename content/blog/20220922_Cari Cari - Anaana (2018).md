### Fabulous surf-punk-everything-including-the-kitchen-sink-psych. This is a recently discovered album from duo Stephanie Widmer (vocals, drums, didgeridoo) and Alexander KÃ¶ck (vocals, guitar) aka Cari Cari.

 Originally thinking they hailed from Australia, (thinking they might have had some lo-fi kinship with the wonderful Aussie duo, HTRK) they are in fact Austrian. An easy mistake to make.

 However, their music sounds multi-continental. Absolutely loving it.
