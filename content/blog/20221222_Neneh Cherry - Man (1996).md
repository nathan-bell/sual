### A bit of Neneh this evening was warranted following an earlier full on, engulfed-by-music moment while driving back into Nelson this afternoon.

 Her sensational duo with Youssou N'Dour, "7 Seconds", playing on the radio completely swallowed me up. At that moment nothing else mattered, including driving with some semblance of control.

 Luckily, my autonomic nervous system kept me safe but like any time of mis-orientation, that level of euphoria just can't be sustained.
