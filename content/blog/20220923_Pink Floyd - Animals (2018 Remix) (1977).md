### Animals has always been my favourite Pink Floyd record so I'm in two minds about people messing with it.

 While I do revere the original, I must admit, this 24-bit high resolution remix is significantly subtle is bringing everything to the fore. 

 However, while itâ€™s had a new lick of sonic paint, it doesn't hide the bleakness. It remains wonderfully dreadful.
