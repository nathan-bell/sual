### I quite like prog (which stands for progressive rock). It's a bit pretentious, like jazz, meandering, like classical. and definitely not mainstream, (un)like pop. It's more recessive rock than progressive in my book. The whole reason punk happened is because of music like this.

 There is a time and a place for this however and tonight's the night. This is just lovely.

 Marillion is one of my newly discovered bands and harks back to the 80's. I picked up 3 of their beautifully produced double albums from their late 90's early 00's for a pittance. I'm slowly working my way through and really enjoying what I hear.

 The "Allmusic.com" reviewer is a bit grumpy about Marillion. They are far more highly regarded elsewhere.
