### This, the Volta's fifth record, is their ambient acoustic country folk rock album. It’s as accessible as they ever get but if you think for a moment it’s not a proper The Mars Volta recording you will be completely deluded. 

 It’s not the sprawling, but exceptionally rewarding mess that is epitomised by their masterwerk “Francis The Mute”, but it does certainly have those more sonically challenging and pretentious moments interspersed with the more conventional, softer side of the unconventional.
