### About as close to Celtic folky stuff that I would chose to get.Â 

 I'm not a great fan at all but this record combines Heidi Berry's wonderful vocal delivery with Violinist Anne Wood's unconventional but stunning string work.  
The chemistry between the two is palpable - especially on "Darkness, Darkness". "Queen" is also a real standout.

 It's a very tasty Friday night record.
