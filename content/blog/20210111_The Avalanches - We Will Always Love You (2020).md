### The Avalanches  "Since I Left You" from 2000 and DJ Shadowâ€™s "Endtroducing" from 1996 are two astounding records produced exclusively from other peoples vocal and musical samples. 

 Bereft of any conventional in-studio recording, they are true cut-and-paste masterpieces. 

 While not quite reaching the same heights, this is still up there with the best releases of 2020. 

 Just waiting for the first album (on double vinyl) to arrive in the post. These records are simply made for vinyl.
