### Do yourself a favour and have a listen to this sure-to-be-an-absolute-classic New Zealand long player.

 This is without doubt the best Westie record I've ever heard. There's a dirty, fuzz box guitar that's dialed right up, slowed right down and just behind the messy sludge of a rhythm section that holds it all together. 

 The vocals are completely off kilter al la Lux Interior hanging at the Roadhouse. Start with "Way Down Low" on side two if you dare!

 Weird days? This is the sanest thing I've heard in the last two years.
