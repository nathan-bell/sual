### It's well over 20 years since Tricky's "Maxinquaye" stunned the music world and topped most "best of" album lists for 1995. While that particular watershed record can never be bettered, this recent release from Tricky is another brilliant collaborative effort.

 My only criticism is that all of the tracks could be a lot longer. Picked up for 2 bucks.
