### Another beautiful double album picked up over Queens Birthday weekend. 

 This features orchestral treatments of Moby songs (thereâ€™s also a lovely reinterpretation of one of my least favorite Bowie songs "Heroes" which I can fully tolerate and appreciate one this).

 The whole record works really well with the addition of several guest vocalists on key tracks.   
  
The hardcore Moby fans hate it - which is nice!

 This really is a classical record and is produced by Deutsche Grammofon, a classical music label established in 1898.
