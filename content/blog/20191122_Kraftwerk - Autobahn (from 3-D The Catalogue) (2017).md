### Whenever I hear Autobahn, I place myself back in the family home in Hastings in 1974. That was a huge moment for me - the day Casey Kasem played the edited, radio friendly version of "Autobahn" on the American Top 40.

 It was a WTF moment. There simply wasn't anything like it in amongst all of the Status Quo, Grand Funk Railroad, Queen, Elton John and all of the other dinosaur bands of the time. 

 Bowie would embrace Krautrock a couple of years later with Station To Station and the Berlin records. The catalyst was out of the bag and experimental, electronic music would start to dominate my tastes.

 This massive box set of ALL of Kraftwerk's 8 albums on Blu-ray, completely rehashed and performed live, is an absolute stunner, and made my trip to Hamilton shit town nearly bearable.
