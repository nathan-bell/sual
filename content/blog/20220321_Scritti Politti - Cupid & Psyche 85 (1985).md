### Lush is the word that sums up this wonderful mid-80s record. It’s also up and over the brim with charm.   
  
A bit dated could also apply but the song-writing and impeccable production make up for any deep dive into that discussion. It’s actually a stupid thing to be hooked on when I hear a reference to a record that is “showing its age”. That’s the charm of listening to music. Whether its The Beatles, Beethoven or The B52s, musical history should not be blamed for existing of the time. It just deserves to be heard for what it is.

 And this record is a real treasure.
