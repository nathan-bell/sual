### More “Jazz Club”! Madlib invades Blue Note.    
  
With unfettered access to the Blue Note catalogue, this record is a mangle of classic jazz that’s completely reinterpreted and re-flavoured.

 It’s still jazz, but not as we know it.   
  
“Proper” jazz is still a bit of a challenge for me. This certainly makes it a lot more palatable.   
Spread out over 4 sides of vinyl the faux wear and tear stains and packaging is superb.
