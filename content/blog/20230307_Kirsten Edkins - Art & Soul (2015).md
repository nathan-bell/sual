### I didn't know anything about this recording before playing this via Tidal this evening. 

 As the reveiw states "Saxophonist Kirsten Edkins delivers a delightful and charming batch of mainstream jazz with her engaging and exuberant debut Art & Soul. 

 The tracks alternate between soulful, smoky burners and cooler, airier ones with relaxed tempos and intricate arrangements."

 Possibly my least favourite musical genre gets a repreive. Something I'd actually listen to more than once.
