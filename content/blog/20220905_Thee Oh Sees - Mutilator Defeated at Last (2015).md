### While I was completely gob smacked with the brilliance of [2018's "Smote Reverser"](http://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2021/12/16/thee-oh-sees-smote-reverser-2018), this is it's little noisy brother. The same sentiments apply just as equally to this album.

 It's old school, squally guitars, mellotron and bongos but the music they make has such heft and power, it's hard to comprehend what just happened. Frightenedly good!

 The only thing that would beat this would be to see them live.
