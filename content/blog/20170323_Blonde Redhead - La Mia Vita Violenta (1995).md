### Next month I'm only playing stuff from bands or artists that I have experienced live. This is a bit of a head start, a band I hold in the highest regard and witnessed live in London in 2014. More on that gig later.Â 

 I've literally waited months with a few false starts and set backs along the way but have finally got my hands on this wonderful vinyl compilation. This is their first two albums along with singles and eps. And it's fucking brilliant.

 Sloppy, discordant and hypnotic. They tightened up a bit for later releases but have never lost that "we fucking do it our way" approach. Up there!!
