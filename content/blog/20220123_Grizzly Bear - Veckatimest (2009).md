### This is a brilliantly mixed up, but carefully contrived mess, that just sounds sensational in all of it's vinyl glory.

 It's the sort of record that also holds you to account. Does one really need all of those records when there are true gems such as this, that will benefit from multiple and repeated listens.

 Love what you have and play these slabs of vinyl to death.
