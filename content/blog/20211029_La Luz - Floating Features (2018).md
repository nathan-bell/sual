### Take a bit of Dick Dale, a good chunk of Stereolab and a smidgeon of Nana Mouskouri, shake it all up, remove the men folk, and you have the sensational lady group La Luz.

 Another GREAT I-have-complete-faith-in-Mr.Smithies moment, this record is testament to his supreme customer focus and Arthur Daley tendencies. 

 Hailing from Seattle, this is their 3rd long playing record. It is VERY, VERY GOOD!!
