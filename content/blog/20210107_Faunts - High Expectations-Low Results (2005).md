7 years to the day, I played this CD. According to my notes "it was a real surprise".

Unsurprisingly, they remain even more surprising. There are numerous style, genre-jumps across the 9 tracks and unless you had this on continuous high-rotation, it would remain one of those unfamiliar, but very rewarding records.

"Hex" by Bark Psychosis does exactly the same thing and this is yet a another reminder to dig a bit deeper. While definitely flying well under the radar, it's a bit of a stunner that deserves more frequent listens.

Faunts hail from Canada.
