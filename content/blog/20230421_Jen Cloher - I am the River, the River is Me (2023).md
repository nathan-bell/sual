### A lovely first listen to Australian singer, Jen Cloher this evening. This beautiful recording took me completely by surprise. 

 Folky, gritty, poppy, and at time crunchy rock. She’s in good company with mates Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile guesting on earlier records, and while they’re not on this, there’s a clear, inherited connect.

 Several songs have lyrics in both English and Maori, so I suspect there’s also a link to New Zealand somewhere.

 Worth checking out further.
