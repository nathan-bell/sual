 While the music can definitely stand-alone on this DVD, the film that accompanies the music on each track beautifully reinforces the historical components that the “found” sounds reference throughout.   
  
The music is original, a combination of guitar, banjo and electronics, with old broadcasting recordings making up the vocals.   
  
It all works very well without taking itself too seriously.
