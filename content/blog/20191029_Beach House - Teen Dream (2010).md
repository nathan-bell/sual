### It's 6 days since I've actually sat down and listened to a full record. Family do take precedence, especially when there's tiny tots involved, but it is a sacrifice you make never the less.

 It's fantastic being with the family and those moments together will be  truly cherished.   
  
There comes a point, however, when you just want your space back. That time is now and I can't think of anything I'd rather listen to at this point in time than this.

  Melodic, mesmeric and cathartic. Perfic(t).
