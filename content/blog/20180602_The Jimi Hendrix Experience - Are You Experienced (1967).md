### This particular record obviously didn’t mean anything to me as a 7 year old when this was released in 1967, but five or 6 years later I definitely remember hearing Hendrix on a big set of headphones at my local church youth club. (However, I don’t remember the exact details as to why?)

 While it wasn’t this specific recording - it was him playing a blistering and literally mind blowing live set.   
  
While the invisible man in the sky, was well departed by then, I may have just possibly found my true messiah (along with my Pete Townsend epiphany on “Live At Leeds”).

 I picked up this wonderful mono, UK version at The Big Red Shed in a sale bin. An absolutely essential purchase.
