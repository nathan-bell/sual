### Usually the Aussies really know how to fuck things up! Rugby Tests against any opposition, humility (never 'erd of it!) and coffee (I've never had a good one over the ditch!). However, I must regretfully advise this ISN'T the case with this gem

 This forth compilation in a series (A Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble) curated by The Amorphous Androgynous collective is an Antipoedan cosmic space music odyssey from 1966 to the present!

 All four volumes of these mind bending compilations are consistently brilliant - "Cosmic Space Music", "Pagan Love Vibrations", "The 3rd Ear" and this "Wizards Of Oz". Get them now!
