 You know what! The Warehouse is really shite!  
  
Once upon a time, and not that long ago, Iâ€™d regularly come home with a bundle of bargains under my arm or in some cases, enough to fill my boot.  Not any more!   
  
Good old, low res Spotify has finally grabbed the non-discerning music consumer by the earbuds.   
The Warehouse is now bereft of decent music media.    
  
A year or so ago I did manage to pick up this monster at a big bargain price.    
  
The only thing bigger than the riffs is the packaging!
