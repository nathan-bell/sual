### While the influences on this, Vanishing Twin's first record are clear, it's nearly impossible to categorise.

 Dream-pop weirdness interweaves with more grounded song structures and several songs clearly fit into the Stereolab and Broadcast camp.

 Then there's the ambient krautrock vibe going on. It's a spectacular and very rewarding mish mash.
