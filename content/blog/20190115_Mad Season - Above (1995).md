### An absolute stonker of a record this evening. This is truly a forgotten gem from the very short-lived Seattle supergroup made up of members of Alice In Chains (Layne Staley), Screaming Trees (Barrett Martin), Pearl Jam (Mike McCready - who I tolerate big time on this record) and some dude called John Baker Saunders. Mark Lanegan also shows up to sing on a few tracks.

 It's wall to wall Psych-Blues with some of the meanest motherfucking riffs and absolutely monumental drumming. Layne Staley also puts in a great effort but sadly his days were becoming numbered.

 I remember buying this at JB-HiFi about 5 years ago and not knowing much about it at all. The first time I played it, my jaw hit the ground. Nothing's changed this evening!
