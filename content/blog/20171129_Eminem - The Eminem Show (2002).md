### I randomised my selection this evening. After causing a recent furore over his rather public disdain for Trump, it's possibly a good time to revisit.

 I heard Eminem's recent diatribe while driving to work. I punched the air in excitement, he was spot on!  
  
His recent rants did however, split opinion right down the middle. What is evident, and slightly concerning, is that half of his fanbase are probably Trump supporters.Â Despite worrying about that, this record is a cracker.

 Best Track(s): Cleanin' Out My Closet.
