### I've got a shit load of Stereolab records to work through. 22 sides of beautifully remastered clear vinyl in fact. There's a new batch of their later catalogue remasters coming soon.

 It certainly isn't a task to be ticked off, I'm finding it a real adventure.   
OK, I've got lots of Stereolab on CD and a DVD compilation but up until now, I hadnâ€™t been driven to play it quite like I am on vinyl.

 It's weird really, Stereolab are true digital maestros but best listened to on analogue.
