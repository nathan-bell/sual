### It's "Bay's Dreams" weekend here in Nelson and things are really kicking off!   
  
Less than 300 metres away from our home in The Wood, it's FANTASTIC to have such a great summer event literally on our backdoor step.   
  
Underworld was a big festival band a couple of decades ago and have made a bit of a come back quality-wise of late.  If they were playing at Trafalgar Park, I'd definitely cross the road to see them!
