### Imagine my surprise a couple of years back going into The Warehouse and discovering this big chunk of vinyl along with two other equally exciting Steven Wilson recordings. 

 These recordings are usually impossible to find at the best specialist record shops, let alone the fucking Warehouse! However, to be fair, this was at a time when the red shed revealed totally unexpected surprises on every second visit - and I'm talking about at least a couple of trips per week. Itâ€™s now bereft of any excitement as music media of any sort is becoming more of a scarcity and the rewards are now minimal.

 Anyhows, enough of this curmudgeonry.  This three-sided LP is a brilliant sampler of SW solo material from his first five records. Like all of his albums, it sounds stunning!
