### A remarkable debut from Manchester duo.

 While seemingly labelled within the "drum'n'bass" genre, it is far too good to be tarnished with that brush. Far from disposable it's eratic beats, bonkers instrumentation and veiled vocals make it as straight forward as a runaway train. Like jazz it's hard to feel it's pulse - it simply won't stay in one place for a moment.

 Infuriating, demanding and mesmerising it's a big wolf...
