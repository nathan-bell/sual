### These dudes started off as a post-new-wave, gothy-punk-avant-garde-noise-band. (It's a proper musical genre, I'm telling you!)  
  
However, I didn't become aware of them until they morphed into a fully fledged white boy funk band and five albums into their 4AD label tenure.   
  
It must have been the 4AD, Throwing Muses/Cocteau Twins connection that pricked my interest. This and their earlier "Queer" record were their last.

 Best tracks: "Going South" "Christianity"
