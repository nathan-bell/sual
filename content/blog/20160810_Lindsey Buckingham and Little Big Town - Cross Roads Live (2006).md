### A nice collaboration between Fleetwood Mac's guitar slinger and popular country harmonists in Live Nashville get together.

 There's a mingle of some old Mac songs and Little Big Town tunes. The match is just about perfect and sound like they have been playing together for years.

 I'm liking this country stuff. Ye ha!
