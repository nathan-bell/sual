### Holy cow! This monster is quite something else. While I don't dig the more chaotic avant guarde elements, there are some simply stunning arrangements and performances.

 Fire! Orchestra is a 43-piece Scandinavian collective led by reeds player and baritone saxophone Jedi Mats Gustafsson, bassist Johan Berthling and drummer Andreas Werliin.

 The opening track, "I See Your Eye, Part 1" is firmly embedded in my cranium. Don't think about finding this on vinyl, it will set you back one fiddy at least.
