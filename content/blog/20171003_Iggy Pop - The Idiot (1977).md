### Bowie's all over this. While "Low" was the high mark of his career, he lent an almighty hand to the Iguana's rehabilitation at the same time. And it definitely shows.

 Very much in the same vein as his Berlin records (the songy bits at least) this was a stunning wake up call for me. I still rate it as one of the most influential bits of music in my lifetime.

 This recent remaster, an HMV London, grey vinyl special edition, has been cleaned up substantially. Still sounds futuristic and unworldly. Brilliant!!!
