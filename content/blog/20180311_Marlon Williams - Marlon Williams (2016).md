### There’s a real glut of Kiwi talent at the moment but fortunately this doesn’t dilute the quality of what’s on offer. There’s been some stunning emerging artists from these parts lately that are truly unique and the ears of the world are pricking up. 

 While it’s mainly the ladies having the real success internationally, Lorde, Nadia Reid and Aldous Harding to name a few, it’s the latter’s ex that is in fine form on this, his breakthrough record. Aldous does also lend a hand on a couple of tracks.

 This is most definitely a country record but Mr. Williams ain’t no ordinary country singer. That voice of his is something to behold. A quirky character but has me completely bewitched.

 Do yourself a favour and watch this ["Tiny Desk Concert"](https://www.npr.org/event/music/557335495/marlon-williams-tiny-desk-concert)
