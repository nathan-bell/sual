### I heard reference to this wonderful record on Radio National today. The cover for Revolver was created by German-born bassist and artist [Klaus Voormann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Voormann), whose birthday it was today. A REALLY interesting character, he's still going strong at 82.

 Revolver was never an album I was overly familiar with, despite knowing most of the songs, but seems to be the record that gets all of the accolades. 

 I can even tolerate the partly atrocious "Yellow Submarine" in context of the other extraordinary songs.
