### What I have here is possibly the single greatest bargain of my entire music media collection.

 This 4x CD compilation and 50 page, brilliantly informative hardback book, cost me 79 cents. 

 It covers the formative UK electronica period from 1975 to 1984. "Excursions in proto-synth pop, DIY techno and ambient explorations"

 Purchased during a recent trawl of Auckland's JB-hifi, today it has proved to be the very welcome antithesis of that abomination that is "The Grammys". 

 Fuck me, what an absolute atrocity of an event. Rich clowns in their ridiculous outfits celebrating their fabricated diversity and over-produced and bloated "products".

 Fucking hideous!!!
