### Don't you just hate it (for those that bow to the inconvenience of vinyl) when the label on side one is different to side two and there's no discernable way of knowing which is side A or side B. (Yes, there's 5 tracks either side)

 OK you may learn for subsequent plays but it is slightly bothersome. There are worse things happening in the world going on however.

 So it comes to pass that on first listen, I played side B first. You know what though, it makes the experience twice as good - you can repeat the experience with a totally new perspective when you listen to it again.

 As far as the music goes, it's a real blast of psychedelic pop that keeps things on the sharp side of accessible but maintains a certain disconcerting edge.
