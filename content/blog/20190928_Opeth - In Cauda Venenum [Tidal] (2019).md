### I’ve gone walkabout with my iPhone and this is usually now my default for new music. I have definitely changed my original stance on only listening properly on a decent stereo system. 

 It’s my first listen on the day of their new release from this classy genre defying Swedish collective. 

 It’s a beautifully produced record and sounds extraordinary on my B&W P7 headphones. Lots of madrigal singing, acoustic guitars and a bit of prog metal thrown in for good measure. 

 This certainly warrants some more concentrated listens. It's complex. It's pretentious. 

 This is considered to be Opeth's most progressive record to date. I really don’t know what that means?
