### Another absolute stunner from one of Afrobeat's finest. This 50th Anniversary Reissue is “coolness” personified.

 Fela was best mates with Ginger Baker, who apparently, (this is uncredited on the album), helps out on the sublime "Egbe Mio".

 If this doesn't get the blood pumping and mood reaching for the stratosphere, there is simply no hope left.

 The splatter vinyl is also one of the prettiest records I've ever seen.
