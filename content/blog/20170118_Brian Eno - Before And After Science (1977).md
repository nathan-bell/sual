### As a young person in their 18th year, I can still remember walking into my local record shop and hearing Bowie's astonishing "Low". It wasn't just the otherworldly music and creative u-turn that stopped me in my tracks but the banter coming from behind and in front of the counter. 

 The undoubted influence of a certain Brian Eno on the overall sound of the record (He is credited as a composer and major musician on it after all) was the hot topic.

 When you do play this gem, you certainly realise just how influencial he was. I'd never heard of Eno at that stage. That changed  pretty quickly.
