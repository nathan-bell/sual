### A beautiful, unconventional rockabilly blues record from now departed Suicide co-founder/co-member, Alan Vega.

 This could quite easily be an old time blues record backed by any number of 70's era Krautrock bands.

 But always dominating at the front of the mix is that truly wonderous voice.

 Not long enough would be my only criticism.
