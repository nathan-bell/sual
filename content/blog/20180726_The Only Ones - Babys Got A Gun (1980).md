### A criminally underappreciated band that I simply couldn't (perhaps can't) get enough of. Peter Perrett's fragile, vulnerable, between-keys voice is stunningly authentic and matched for uniqueness and virtuosity by John Perry's amazing fret work.  
  
A match made on another planet.Â  Critics, however few and far between, weren't favourable about this release. This is most definitely, my favourite Only Ones record.

 Peter Perrett, minus the heroin addition that plagued most of his musical existence, returned in 2017 with the brilliant and much lauded ["How The West Was One"](https://www.allmusic.com/album/how-the-west-was-won-mw0003042594)
