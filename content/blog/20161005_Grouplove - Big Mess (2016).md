### I didn't know much about this LA group before impulsively booking a ticket to see them play at the Electric Ballroom in Camden. 

 I warmed to it slightly after listening to it on Tidal one or two times in anticipation of the event. It was ok.

 But hey, what do you know - I was absolutely sucker punched by their astounding performance. What a band! What a gig! What a record! Somehow all of these happy clappy pop songs sounded so familiar. They had seeped into my brain.   
  
I'll definitely be playing this all summer long. My new favorite discovery.
