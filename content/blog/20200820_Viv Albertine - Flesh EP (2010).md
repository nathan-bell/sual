### Viv Albertine (once guitarist with The Slits) is my new hero.   
  
I've just finished reading her brilliant autobiography. (This should be compulsory reading for every man on the planet!)

 In making this record she learnt how to play guitar again (she never really could) took to the stage (she suffered terribly prior to performing) and became a vocalist (she really couldn't sing).   
  
The same singular and "anyone can" philosophy demonstrated with the Slits 30 years earlier, comes to the fore again on this wonderful 4 track EP.
