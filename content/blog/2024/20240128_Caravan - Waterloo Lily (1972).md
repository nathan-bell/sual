### Aside from a couple of Caravan compilations and 1 proper studio album, 1970's "If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You", I'm a complete Caravan and to be fair, "Canterbury Sound" novice.

Just for some context, I have a few dedicated, music and record-geek, YouTube feeds.
T
oday I happened to be watching Jim Newstead's "Adventures in Music" and came across this clip from 12 months ago. [Listening to Caravan: Waterloo Lily (Part 1)](https://youtu.be/3g9yVkjdLh4)
   
He was having a first ever listen to Caravan's "Waterloo Lily". 
It was great to see his reaction and an interesting way to listen to the whole album.
 
Anyway, after watching 20 minutes or so, I decided to have a listen myself (streaming via Tidal). 
 
All I can say is give this great album a listen - it's well worth your time.  Its folk, its jazz, its rock, itâ€™s all over the show. It's also 50 odd years old and needs to be re-valuated.
