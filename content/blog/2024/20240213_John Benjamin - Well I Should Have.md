> I don't play piano, at all, and I'm not a huge fan of jazz. I never was.  And that's why I thought it would be funny to make a jazz album

I still laugh every time I watch this.  Jon Benjamin, comedian and voice of "Bob" from "Bob's Burgers" decided to make a Jazz album despite not being able to play the piano, and not really even liking jazz, and it works out pretty much how you'd expect.
