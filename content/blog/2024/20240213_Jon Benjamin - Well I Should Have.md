> _I don't play piano, at all, and I'm not a huge fan of jazz. I never was.  And that's why I thought it would be funny to make a jazz album_ - H. Jon Benjamin

I still laugh every time I watch this.  Jon Benjamin, comedian and voice of "Bob" from "Bob's Burgers" decided to make a Jazz album despite not being able to play the piano, and not really even liking jazz, and it works out pretty much how you'd expect.

The more you listen to it, the funnier it gets.
