> Bill Wurtz released a 20-minute overview of world history, _history of the entire world, i guess_, on May 10, 2017.

The video took over 11 months to produce, including almost 3 months of research â€“ it briefly covers the topics of natural history and human civilization spanning from the Big Bang to the near future. The video marked the continued development of Wurtz's cinematic style, with fast-paced, absurdist humor and jazz-like musical interludes.

If you've not seen it before you owe it to yourself to give it a watch.
