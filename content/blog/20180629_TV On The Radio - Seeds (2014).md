### I did the $2 grab bag from TWH this afternoon. Picked up eight quite obscure albums (including The Pop Group's "Citizen Zombie" and Iron and Wine's "Sing Into My Mouth") - all for under 20 bucks.  
  
As I've said many times, you need to put the effort in to find treasure in them bins or in this case, still on the shelf.  
  
This 2014 release by TVOTR is a cracker and is the main reason I went looking. I had seen it a week earlier but failed to pounce. The other 7 CDs I found were an unexpected bonus.
