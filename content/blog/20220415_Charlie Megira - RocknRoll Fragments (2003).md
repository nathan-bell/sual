### Holy Moly, Charlie Megira's whole world has now opened up to me after a visit to my local recently. 

 (The fact that my local is a combined craft beer pub and record store, means it's the ultimate one stop shop!)

 This beautifully packaged double LP is one of the most surprising and delightful records I've ever encountered. 

 Charlie Megira, aka Gabriel “Gabi” Abudraham, who died in 2016, was an Israeli musician who combined Rockabilly and surf music in truly extraordinary ways.

 Sounding both ultra alien and overtly familiar at the same time, this compilation is just fabulous.
