### I left home in 1977 and remember trying to find my "cool". I never did find it but this was as close as I got to at least planting a seed.  
  
Seduction of the opposite sex was high on the agenda and Boz playing in the background was far less sleazy than Barry White!!  
  
It was a few years later when I met my first (and only) wife Sarah. I distinctly remember Boz doing most of the talking.

 I've been eying up a copy of this record on vinyl at the red shed for the last month. Today I needed to make the purchase.Â   
  
As well as being one of the coolest records ever, this might be up there as one of the most important. It just may have played more of a role in cementing my future than I ever gave it credit.
