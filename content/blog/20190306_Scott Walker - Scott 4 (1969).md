### This record is the late 60's crooning Scott Walker NOT the so-fucking-out-there, avant-garde-doesn't-do-it-justice Scott Walker of a more recent era.

 That later day Scott Walker still claims top spot for the most profound Shut Up And Listen session ever experienced in nearly 2 decades! It was a complete WTF! moment.

 I'm not sure if I'm a great admirer of this early stuff though? It's pleasant enough but hardly challenging on first listen. Apparently, if you dig deep lyrically it all starts to make sense...
