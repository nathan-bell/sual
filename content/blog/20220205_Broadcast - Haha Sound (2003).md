### Aside from the impeccable music on this record, the first thing that really strikes you is the quality of the packaging.

 The great cover art has a classy sheen and is on the thickest, smoothest cardboard I've ever seen.   
This is all courtesy of Warp Records.

 Even the [website](https://warp.net/artists) is all class. 

 This is a repress of their second album and up until now, has been jolly hard to find. What a great find today.
