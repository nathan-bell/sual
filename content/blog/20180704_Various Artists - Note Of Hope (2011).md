### Woody Guthrie purists are particularly disapproving of this release - it does show up in the reviews. Get over it people, Dylan went electric decades ago and it was about folkin' time.  
  
To be perfectly honest, folk music, in it's purist form, leaves me a bit bereft of excitement.  
  
Fully sanctioned by Woody's daughter Nora, this is a diverse collection of new songs written to unreleased Guthrie lyrics. It is wonderfully led by the fantastic bass playing of Rob Wassermann who died in 2016. Disregard the miserabilists this is a fantastic record. I picked it up a few years ago for $1.98.
