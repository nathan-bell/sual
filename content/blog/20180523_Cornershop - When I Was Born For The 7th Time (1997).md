### It's astounding to realise that this gem was made more than 20 years ago! Played for the first time in it's entirety in at least a decade, I am reminded of just how good it is.  
  
It is obviously a record that was played to death. It just sounds so "familiar".

 Fellow SUAL member, and ex neighbour Chris, played the wonderful "Candy Man" at our monthly get together last night and it definitely prodded my memory banks.  
  
This record is just chock full of the biggest hooks and witty banter. The lyric "Everyone needs a bosom for a pillow" has never been bettered.
