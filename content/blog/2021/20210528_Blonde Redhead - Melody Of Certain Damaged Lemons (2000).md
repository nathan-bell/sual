### I was really pleased recently to find a re-pressed, USA made copy of this early Blonde Redhead record. 

 This is definitely a band worthy of owning everything they did on vinyl.

 Consistently brilliant over the course of nearly three decades, Blonde Redhead, who are often wrongly compared to Sonic Youth, are truly incomparable.
