### This universally panned solo record by the Dexy's Midnight Runner front man is an absolute treasure.

 The controversial cover probably didn't help matters but it's clear the critics weren't actually listening.

 The songs are all cover versions and include "Daydream Believer", "Rag Doll" and a stonking version of Bruce's "Thunder Road".
