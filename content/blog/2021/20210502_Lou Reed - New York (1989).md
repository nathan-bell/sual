### Excluding the Velvet Underground years, Transformer, Rock'n'roll Animal, Lou Reed Live, The Blue Mask, Legendary Hearts, Songs For Drella (with John Cale) and Magic And Loss were always my go to Lou Reed records.

 Aside from hearing one or two tracks off this album, I've largely missed this critically revered record from the late 80s.

 All of those aforementioned albums with the possible exception of Magic And Loss were loved more for their incredible musicianship than Lou's poetic ramblings. Notably, Magic and Loss was more cathartic at the time.

 Mick Ronson, Dick Wagner, Steve Hunter, Robert Quine, Fernando Saunders were all exceptional.

 This record, now that I've finally heard it, has another extraordinary musician in bassist Rob Wasserman. What's also exquisite is the width and breath of Lou's story telling

 Lyrically and musically brilliant, this record now goes on that list.
