### The Babelsberg Basement Tapes.

 This Record Store Day is the "raw" version of his wonderful apocalyptic 2018 album "Babelsberg".

 Despite being a tirade on Trumpian America the wonderful song writing is never at the expense of the message. Itâ€™s a toe tapping tune-smithing masterwork of the highest quality. 

 The Super Furry Animal front man has never failed to deliver.
