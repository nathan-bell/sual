### I really struggle with New Order these days. Despite this, I can still play Joy Division to death.

 For me they just haven't aged well. Their first proper record ["Movement" remains bearable](https://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2021/1/7/new-order-movement-1981) and the track "Everythingâ€™s Gone Green" is classic transitional JD/NO.

 I just think I prefer them as an historical moment in time. Revered then but not treasured in any way now. I have "Movement" on vinyl and everything by Joy Division.

 Peter Hook is just a big plonker and can fuck off!
