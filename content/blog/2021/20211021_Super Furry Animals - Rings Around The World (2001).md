### My full and ongoing membership of "Shut Up And Listen" depended on the success of my audition and my overly strategic song management.

 Choosing the phenomenal track "Juxtapozed with U" by this band and a spliced version of Nitin Sawhney's "Nadia" followed by Jeff Beck's cover version, just may have convinced the panel of my worthiness.

 (I'm thinking that The Smiths "Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others" may have been my third track??)

 Considering "Rings Around The World" was made in 2001, I assume I'm approaching 20 years of membership. I was therefore thrilled to received my double vinyl edition of this newly remastered 2021 version by courier today. 

 Probably one of the most vinyl-worthy records in my entire collection.
