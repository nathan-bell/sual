### This LP was literally thrust into my hands the other day with the messaage "This will be right up your street".

 I'm always up for a punt on an unknown and I can happily report that this record won't be going anywhere fast, except for another spin on my record player.

 Self-produced, self-recorded Kiwi artist Amelia Murray makes lush, edgy pop music with a hint of grungy lo-fi thrown in for good measure.

 A nice little surprise then and full marks for the recommendation.
