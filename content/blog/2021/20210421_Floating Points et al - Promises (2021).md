### Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders & The London Symphony Orchestra

 A record (in this case an album streaming from Tidal) that demands nothing.

 It's best to just concede and let everything wash over you as the beautiful melody and texture repeats endlessly over it's 46 minutes.

 It is a remarkable journey. Not at all suitable for vinyl.
