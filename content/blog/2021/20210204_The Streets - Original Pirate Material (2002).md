### One of my favourite British series ever is "[People Just Do Nothing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3762198/)" 

 This is a mockumentary series about a group of failed MCs from West London and their passion for pirate radio.

 The daily dramas of Grindah, Beats, Chabuddy G, Steves, Decoy and Grindah's girlfriend Roche is just priceless. 

 If they were any good, and if you believe their own hype this record would be their self-produced and famous soundtrack. 

 However, Kurupt FM, the pirate radio with a listening audience of about three, is simply abysml. 

 In the real world this record is from one of Birmingham's finest and no where near West London.
