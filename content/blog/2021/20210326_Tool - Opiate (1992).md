### Maynard James Keenan hit the ground running with his band Tool. This and subsequent records completely shocked the world of metal, grunge and alternative rock.

 While this EP is a bit all over the place, the embryo of something truly special was unfurled on the world.

 I've just finished reading Maynard's book "A Perfect Union Of Contrary Things" which is a fascinating account of what he and this band stands for and why he's a completely unique, multifaceted and ultra-driven individual.

 Tool continues to be a band that is impossible to define.
