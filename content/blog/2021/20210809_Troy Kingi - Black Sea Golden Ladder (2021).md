### Tickets booked, I'd better have a listen. This is Troy Kingi's "folk" record with Delaney Davidson, the proper folkie, lending a steady hand.

 From the first track to the last track, it's superb story telling encased in a brilliant gothic soundtrack. 

 His guitar playing, especially his slightly back in the mix, dirty electric sound, keeps things on edge and Delaney Davidson is the master of understated support vocals, harmonising beautifully on several tracks.

 Fabulous.
