### Tim Burgess & Bob Stanley Present Songs For A Late-Night Diner.

 This very quirky compilation "is a soundtrack for a mythical caf√© in the mythical north" somewhere in England.

 Very subtle and disturbingly Lynchian this is an obvious carry-over from similarly surreal Jane Weaver record the other day. 

 She even sings a track. Great background music to prepare a meal to and completely mess up the ingredients.
