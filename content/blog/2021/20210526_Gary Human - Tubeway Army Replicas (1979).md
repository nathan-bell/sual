### Gazza has always been an outlier/outsider. Diagnosed with Asperger’s  his imagination and creativity has actually got the better of him. He’s been more prolific than ever and his latest record "Intruder" is up there’s with his best. 

 This old relic saw out the 70’s and influenced the decades ahead.

 "You Are In My Vision" is a personal favorite.
