### Another fantastic find in Melbourne was arguably Lou Reed's best ever (official) live record "Live In Italy" which was recorded in 1983. 

 Featuring the best band he ever assembled, an incredibly talented Robert Quine on guitar (He and Reed hated each other), the amazing Fernando Saunders on bass and Fred Maher on drums.

 This is Lou in top form covering quite a big chunk of the Velvets material.
