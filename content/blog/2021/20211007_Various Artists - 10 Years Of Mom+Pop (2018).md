### This is the headline: "THREE YEARS OF BIN WATCHING AT JB-HIFI IN LOWER HUTT FINALLY PAYS OFF"

 I had an absolutely brilliant haul of less-costly-than-second-hand, new records from the bins at the yellow and black shed. Believe it or not, this particular box set had sat in that bin for close to 3 years.

 I was very pleased with myself as I took my bundle up to the counter along with this triple vinyl box. It was slashed from $100+ to $50. 

 However, that was not the end. Much to my surprise it was slashed by a further $26 at the till. It ended up costing me $24.

 And what a brilliant thing it is. 32 exceptional tracks over 6 sides including rarities and covers from such artists as Courtney Barnett, Neon Indian, Sleigh Bells, Polica, Tom Morello, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and Tash Sultana.

 An eclectic mix in a fantastic package - it also includes a beautiful 36 page commemorative book and poster.
