### As well as this record being unlike anything before or after it, it's one of the quietest "loud" records you will ever hear.

 This noise isn't about volume, it's about the layer upon layer of swirling, de-tuned guitars and barely audible vocals.

 If this was a painting, it would be a Jackson Pollack. 

 This is a newly minted, analogue remaster on beautiful black vinyl.
