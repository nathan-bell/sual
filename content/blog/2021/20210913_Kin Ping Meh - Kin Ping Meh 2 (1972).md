### Second album from German band "Kin Ping Meh" (Chinese for "The Golden Lotus")

 There's a definite "The Yes Album" feel to early proceedings with more than a few weird meanderings along the way.

 They completely butcher a version of The Beatles "Come Together" but it's so completely out there, it doesn't matter one iota.

 Throw in some banjo and we're suddenly playing country and western.  “I wanna be lazy” is Blur circa 1972.  Time for a lie down perhaps.
