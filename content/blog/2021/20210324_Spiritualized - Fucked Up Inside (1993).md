### Great live recording of Jason Pierce's early post Spacemen 3 collective. 

 While it gets off to an unexpectedly noisy start with a barrage of crackles and pops all over the first track, (sometimes I really hate vinyl), but this is soon forgotten as it mainlines itself into my brain.

 It's a truly remarkable racket that only the brave could tolerate in the live arena. On record it's thankfully more manageable when the volume knob is in easy reach as the cacophony ebbs and flows accross both sides.

 This magnificent monstrosity is not one for the neighbours.
