### Fantastic documentary about the making of "Rainbow Bridge", a complete Blu-Ray concert recording and 6 sides of Vinyl capturing Jimi Hendrix's concert at Maui, Hawaii in 1970.

 It turned out to be a pretty crap movie but the concert footage preserved here proved to be one of his best performances. 

 Picked up as a significantly mis-priced set at JB-Hifi. Right place, right time.
