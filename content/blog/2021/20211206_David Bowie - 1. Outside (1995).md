### For many, this could be their introduction to David Bowie. For me, I had already kicked him into touch a decade and a half earlier following "Let's Dance".

 I have no shame in finally having the courage to re-kindle my interest in his post 80's recordings. I have been far from disappointed so far, there's many a treasure to be re-discovered.

 And this just reinforces it. While it's a meandering mess at times, his re-partnership with Brian Eno has clearly won back the dressing room.

 Reeves Gabriels absolutely shreds on this, especially "The Hearts Filthy Lesson" and the Bowie/Eno/Garson/Alomar team are certainly in the premier league.

 Again, the sound is stunning on this new vinyl pressing.
