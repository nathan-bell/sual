### There was only going to be one album to listen to this evening. After yesterday's fabulous Alan Vega and Stephen Lironi show, it's time for some Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto.

 Last night's riveting and highly rewarding experience warranted a listen to something equally absorbing. 

 Pete Shelley, who passed away recently, and Howard Devoto were both members of The Buzzcocks before Howie went off and formed the magnificent Magazine.

 They join forces very successfully on this wee gem 25 years later.
