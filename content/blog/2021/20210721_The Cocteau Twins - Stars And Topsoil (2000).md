### Picked this fine compilaton up from my second favourite Melbourne record shop, Rocksteady Records in Lonsdale St, CBD.

 Just $33 Aussie dollars for a 2 LP white vinyl record is exceptional value. This is a great starting point for anyone unfamiliar with the Cocteau Twins dirge.

 Be warned however, it will polarise the unsuspecting listener immediately. There's simply no in-between.
