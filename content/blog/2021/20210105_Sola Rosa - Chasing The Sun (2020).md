### Andrew Spraggon was once a solo knob twiddler. He was also once a touring member of Dimmer (as revealed on a recent RNZ Music 101 podcast)

 Heâ€™s now the ultimate collaborator. This incredibly funky record has enough bottom end and rich, big band production to power the main stage at Bay Dreams - which just so happens to be happening as I play this.   
  
It's funky town time!
