### It's 40 years since Japan released their 1981 masterpiece "Tin Drum".   
Along with Kraftwerk, Echo & The Bunnymen and Magazine, it was a watershed moment for me.

 I dug out this rather rare DVD of some video promos and their amazing live performance at Hammersmith Odeon in November 1982 that was recorded for "Oil On Canvas" 

 Lead bass player Mick Karn is simply astounding. John Entwhistle and Jaco Pastorious led the way with syrupy bass lines as a lead instrument, Mick Karn ramps it up to another level still.
