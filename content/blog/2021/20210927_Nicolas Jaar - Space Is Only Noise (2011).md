### This is an exquisite, sumptuous recent discovery courtesy of the wonderful [45 RPM Audiophile YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc1G80Jjz1vkJKVqUy2zmoQ/featured) hosted by Michael the German.

 Michael, who is a truly engaging German man with the most incredible vinyl collection, regularly shares his insights into the best, and often but not always, audiophile vinyl pressings.

 This record was one of his recommendations for electronic records and it's a stunner. I have also a matter of minutes ago discovered that he is a member of the truly fabulous duo "Darkside".

 Well I never.
