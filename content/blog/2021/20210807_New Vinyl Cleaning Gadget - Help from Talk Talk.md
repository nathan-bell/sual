### More of a DIY brag this evening. To breath new life into your record collection give them a bath!

 This version of "It's My Life" got the treatment today and boy does it make a difference.

 You can spend a fortune on vacuum and ultra-sonic machines but a bit of elbow grease and a cheap spinner does an outstanding job.

 It even pays to give your brand new records a whirl - there's factory crap gunging up the grooves.

 I use a combination of [Vinyl Styl Deep Groove Washer System](https://flyingout.co.nz/collections/turntables-accessories/products/vinyl-styl-deep-groove-record-washer-system) and Spin Clean washing fluid. The result is brilliant.

 (Don't use the shit stuff that comes with the Vinyl Styl kit).
