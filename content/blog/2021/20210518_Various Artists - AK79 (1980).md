### This fantastic compilation of Auckland punk, circa 1979(ish), is a treat for NZ music historians and rock'n'roll lovers. 

 There's early iterations of bands that went on to greater fame, and much higher production standards, but their brilliance is well in evidence.

 Toy Love especially stand out as something really special.
