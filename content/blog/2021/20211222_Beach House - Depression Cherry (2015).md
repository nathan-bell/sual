### A very ethereal record from Beach House. 

 Sounding like its big fluffy red cover (I kid you not) this recording is enclosed in a murky haze that keeps the poppy sugar coating that's trying its hardest to bust out under wraps. Just.

 This fairly recent release reminds me of Mid-80's Lush, Julie Cruise and My Bloody Valentine.
