### This record, the first in a trilogy of great Jane Weaver albums, is a real treat.

 The vocals are as ethereal and fabulous as the noodlely electronics and keyboard embellishments that cocoon each track. This is Julee Cruise/David Lynch territory and could easy soundtrack any one those crazy episodes from the last series of Twin Peaks.

 Absolutely essential.
