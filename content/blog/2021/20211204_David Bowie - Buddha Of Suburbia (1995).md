### To be honest, this is an album I never really knew existed. Made after "Black Tie White Noise‚Äù and around the time of "Outside" to soundtrack a British TV series, it never appeared on my radar at all.

 Released for the first time on vinyl with this box set, it's quite exciting to hear this completely fresh. It's not just a curiosity in his canon of great records, it quite honesty feels like it should be up there with his best.

 Mike Garson returns for some wonderful ivory work and Lenny Kravitz plays guitar on another version of the title track.

 This wonderful box which contains this great, newly discovered gem, is already becoming essential.  
To think I was resolved to not owning this. Just one more big box to go.
