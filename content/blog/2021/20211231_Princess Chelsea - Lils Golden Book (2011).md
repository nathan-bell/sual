### At this time of year who wants to overthink the previous 12 months? For most of us it's been a proper, global annus horribilis. A year best forgotten.

 A certain amount of quiet reflection is called for this evening and an acknowledgement of those simple, taken-for-granted things. God things could be so much worse.

 This special little record from Chelsea Nikkel is just the tonic. Na√Øve, but incredibly catchy little electronic ditties which dive deep into Kiwi life.

 Her take on Kiwi travel is especially relevant, if you can get home that is.

 *We skimp, we save. We go overseas. We leave those behind who gives us what we need.In two years we return with a sigh of relief. But we say it was better.*

 Now fuck off 2021!
