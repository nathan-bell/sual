### Soul Records Presents: Afro-Centric Visions In The Age Of Black Power. Underground Jazz, Street Funk & The Roots Of Rap (1968-79)

 I bought a book. "What a revelation" you may say! Well actually, I bought it a while ago on my travels up North a few months back.  And it IS actually a revelation. The book is called ["You've Never Heard Your Favourite Song" by Matthew Doucet.](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Youve-Never-Heard-Your-Favorite-Song/Matthew-Doucet/Curios/9781604339703)

 What the book does is recommend 100 tracks across multiple genres "to make your world sound better". 

 I've made a habit of dipping into it every day to explore and read about at lease one of his recommended tracks. So far the hit rate of remarkableness has been 100%.   
  
In keeping with my current mode of musical exploration, I'm cracking open one of my many Soul Jazz compilations, many of which have gone largely unheard.  This Soul Jazz Record is a real cracker with nary a wasted note. Now do yourself a favour and listen to something you've never heard before.

 This record has also opened another can of worms - "Black Lives Matter".  Listen to this, read the liner notes and then watch “I Am Not Your Negro”.
