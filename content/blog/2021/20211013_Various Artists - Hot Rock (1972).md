### It's time to get my boys out again. This compilation from the early 70's is probably one of my holy grails as far as musical discovery goes.

 Every single one of these 24 tracks elicits fond memories of naively sponging up everything in my path.

 Golden Earring, Mountain, Rory Gallagher, Uriah Heep, The Velvet Underground, Juicy Lucy, Van Der Graaf Generator and many more...

 "Get a whiff of this!"
