### [7' and rare stuff 2009/2014]

 I've been putting off listening to this virgin vinyl. I was really worried about being disappointed. 

 The brilliance of their 2010 debut still resonates strongly and I just can't fathom anything being as good as that.

 I needn't have bothered however, it's already right up there after just the first three or four tracks. And it only gets better.

 Fuzzed-out, reverb-infused, French garage music straight out of the 60's that's just too cool to be possible.
