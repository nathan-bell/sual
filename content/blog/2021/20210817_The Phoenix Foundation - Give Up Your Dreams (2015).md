### In recognition of brilliant Kiwi musicians Iâ€™m celebrating with some Wellington heavy weights today. Let's  face it - we need to go to all of those touring NZ artists touring at the moment - for their and for our own sakes.

 Troy Kingi and Delaney Davidson tonight. [Got cancelled as we went into Level 4 lockdown]

 Love the laidback, poppy, psych vibe going down. 

 Less than favourable review from Pitchfork. They can sit and spin!
