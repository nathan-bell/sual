### Another great Easter Weekend purchase while over in the windy city.

 This is Porridge Radio's second record and their first "proper" big label release. They are from Brighton.

 The track "Sweet" was played at the last Shut Up and Listen Session. It was one of the stand out tracks.

 There's an extra record of other tracks which I haven't listened to yet. But will. It's also on lovely swirly purple vinyl. Which is nice.

 The record is droll but direct - a bit like me trying to explain it. Just listen is my advice.
