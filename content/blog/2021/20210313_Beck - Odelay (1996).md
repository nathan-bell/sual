### There's still a lot of life left in ye old compact disc. This album is the epitome of digital geek where studio trickery and massive production nearly trumps the incredible songwriting. 

 Having this on vinyl would just seem highly ostentatious. The deluxe CD version will do me nicely thankyou. A masterwork of every known musical genre known to man.
