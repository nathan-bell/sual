### Gave this a whirl this evening as I cooked. A bit indifferent for the first couple of tracks but then it all clicked. 

 More poppy than their other two earlier records but as you would expect from producer Josh Homme, there’s some great chops.

 Also listened to a couple of brilliant SACDs this evening. Bowie’s "Ziggy  Stardust" and Peter Gabriel's "Shaking The Tree". 

 For me this largely forgotten and mostly defunct format is just about the pinnacle of sound quality. 

 The message for me now is vinyl is great, but don't forget all of the other music media formats.
