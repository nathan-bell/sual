### An absolute gem of a record found on my recent excursion up North. Discovered second hand at "Low Cost Records" in Petone, this record was always one of my favourites.   
  
I think it also introduced me to Al Di Meola. His guitar work on this, especially on "Mysteries Of Love", is just stunning. All the musicians are exceptional and vocalist on a couple of tracks, Linda Lewis is just magic.
