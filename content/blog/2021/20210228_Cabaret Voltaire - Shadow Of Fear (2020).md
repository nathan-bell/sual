### I LOVE this! While it's really Richard H. Kirk's baby now, Stephen Mallinder now long departed, this really truly sounds likes a new Cabs record.

 The thing that completely sells it for me is the fact it hasn't aged one iota. There's simply no modern reference to compare it to.

 While it's not as raw or challenging as peak Cabs, and now bereft of Stephen Mallinder's abrasive vocals, it certainly has all of it's past bones.
