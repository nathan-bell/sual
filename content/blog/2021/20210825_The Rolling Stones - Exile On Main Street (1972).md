### **RIP Charles Robert Watts**

 An easy choice today. I bought this quite a few years ago when I started collecting "essential" vinyl once again.

 It was a ridiculously cheap price from The Big Red Shed and has not been played until today. Time to bring it out then.

 So here's to you Charlie Watts.
