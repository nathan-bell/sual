### Hamilton-born, Kimbra Johnson is really hard to categorise.  There's simply no doubt about it though, she's one hell of a talent. And without shoving it your face.

 Maybe, a minor misstep was her involvement with the revamped "Popstars 2021" as a panelist/mentor. But lets face it who the hell am I in the scheme of things for anyone to care?  And she's got to make a living.

 This is a great debut record with a wide range of genres. Hard to define, very easy to listen to.
