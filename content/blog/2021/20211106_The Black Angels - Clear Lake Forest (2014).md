### This slightly warped EP (literally and figuratively - physically, its a bit on the bendy side) from Texans "The Black Angels" sounds like it really shouldn't work at all and at times it's just way off being pleasant.

 However, despite the mess, you dig out the great stuff any way you can. Annoyingly great.
