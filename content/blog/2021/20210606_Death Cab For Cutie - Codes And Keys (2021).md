### Great random choice this evening as I let my music database choose my music for me. I always warm to a bit of Death Cab for Cutie. 

 This is one of later efforts and adds some experimentation to proceedings.

  Incidentally, the database I use is Discogs https://www.discogs.com/ a fantastic free web-based resource to catalogue and valuate all of your CDs and LPs (it does Blu-Ray and DVD as well).

 It's a lot of effort at first but you simply use your smart phone and discogs app to scan the barcode. I've entered about 3000 items so far. Great for getting a valuation of your purchases and good for insurance purposes.

 Any new purchase gets scanned immediately.
