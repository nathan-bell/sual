### I remember seeing Suede on TV whilst on holiday in Hastings around the time of the release of this album (Jools Holland if I remember) and was totally blown away.

 The lanky chisel-faced singer at his manic, not quite vitriolic best, spitting out vocals with the passion of a Dave Vanian supported by the rowdiest, most melodic glam band since Bowie's Spiders From Mars.Â 

 It was definitely the Brett Anderson show however. His solo records are quite brilliant as well. Just magic!
