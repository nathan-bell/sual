### I swear, I will NEVER attend a live Mogwai event. I'm long past going to sonically damaging gigs where your ears fight for recovery for the next few days and your internalised speech sounds like an old transistor radio.

 I've been to a few of those gigs - Living Force (Fuck yes!!), Jakob, 8 Foot Sativa, Smashing Pumpkins and good old Grinderman. Apparently Mogwai are in a league of their own.

 This is a fantastic black and white film of one of their New York gigs circa 2009. There are several glimpses of punters holding their ears but there's no blood that I can see.

 It's a brilliant document of the legendary Scottish band in full flight.
