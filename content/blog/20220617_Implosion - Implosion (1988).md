### Back in late May I discovered a fabulous, genre-less, probably more-prog-than-not, largely instrumental rock outfit from Italy.

 [That record](http://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2022/6/5/implosion-implosion-2020-2020) was a compilation of great, unreleased music from the mid to late 80's and an addendum to this, their first and at one point, very rare, under-the-radar release.

 Well here it is. And it is as corny and wonderful as ever.
