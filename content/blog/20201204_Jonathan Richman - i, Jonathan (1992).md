### "The Modern Lovers", from 1976 is in my top 10 records of all time. (The Modern Lovers was also the name of the band fronted by the Jonathan Richman.)

 This solo record made nearly 2 decades later in 1992, is an absolute gem of a record.  It's also a record we could all take some time out to listen to at the moment.

 It's subject matter, especially "Parties in the USA" and it's prophetic sentiment hasn't aged at all.
