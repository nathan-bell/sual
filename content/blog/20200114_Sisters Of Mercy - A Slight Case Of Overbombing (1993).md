### This greatest hits (volume one) is a non-stop riff fest - I'm not kidding.   
  
This record is unrelentless and all of the songs are super extended versions.   
This is the Sisters at their dark, gothy mid-to-late 80s best. If you want to get somewhere fast in your car, just put this baby on. You'll be thrashing along the highway with your foot to the pump. It's a totally unavoidable consequence of experiencing this.   
  
Just wrap your ears around "Lucretia My Reflection" and test it out.
