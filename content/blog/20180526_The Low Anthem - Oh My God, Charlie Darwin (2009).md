I actually bought this record on the strength of the worlds greatest biologist and non-theist mischief-maker being mentioned on the album cover. (A really good review in the music press also helped to be honest).  
  
It's a very eclectic record that explores many different styles. While fitting most comfortably in the alt-country genre it's a lot more complex than that. There's gospel, there's a bit of electronic noodling and there's a couple of full on rockers.  
  
It's a record that never outstays its welcome.
