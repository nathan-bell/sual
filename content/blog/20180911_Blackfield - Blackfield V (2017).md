### Steven Wilson and Aviv Geffen return for their best collaborative effort in donks. A true Blackfield return to form I reckon.

 Despite this being a semi-conceptual record about oceanic themes, all of the songs are truly stand-alone and there's little sense of any obvious progressive glue.

 I particularly like the direction this record takes, especially with the track "Lonely Soul". It's  innovative, albeit in the Blackfield scheme of things, but remains pure ear candy.
