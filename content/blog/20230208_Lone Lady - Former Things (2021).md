### Time warp, flash back alert. Thereâ€™s a somewhat wacky (corny even!) minimalistic analogue synth and drum machine vibe happening on this surprisingly catchy recent release. This is something you might have expected in mid 80s New Wave Manchester, certainly not made for this age. New Order, early Human League and a soft-centered Cabaret Voltaire come to mind. 

 Another great headphone listen.

 I continued to listen to this complete earworm of a record during a couple of flights over the weekend away. It's a bit of a Kylie moment. "Can't get you out of my head!"
