### While I continue to lap up everything Mr. Wilson does, he could fart the Lord's Prayer and I'd still be consuming his product, it's very hard to find Steven Wilson product in this country.

 This guy is the real deal and his chameleon approach to always moving on musically would be second only to Bowie's amazing 1970's. However, because of this particular record and possibly the previous one, the vitriol amongst largely British Prog-heads is just embarrassing.

 Why would someone with his talent go off and do something different? You know what though, it's really not. It's the same impeccable and consistent songwriting and musicianship he's displayed over several decades. 

 I tell you what, it's tough being a Spurs fan but it's nothing compared to being a Steven Wilson/Porcupine Tree appreciator. What a fickle bunch.
