### Another great $1 find. Fat Freddy's guitarist Tehimana Kerr goes solo on this merge of ambient, electronica and funk.

 Beautifully produced as you would expect, it's an interesting and unexpected sonic journey.

 Full of surprises, it actually gets even better as it progresses through a range of genres.
