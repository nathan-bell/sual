### It’s only been 14 years since their last record! What’s the big deal!

 Listening for the first time with my best pair of headphones, it's something I thought I would never hear in 2019.

 A big fat, hairy rock record with some of the most impeccable musicianship I've ever heard. Guitars, drums, bass and vocals from another planet.

 I've seen them live a couple of times - I can't wait to experience them delivering this 14 year old infant terrible!
