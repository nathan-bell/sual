### Itâ€™s really hard to believe that this wonderful record was made the year I started working in my current (and hopefully last) job. Now that's 14 years ago! I simply can't fathom the time that has past and my mind is still suggesting that it's been a lot less than that. I'll let my cerebrum fight that battle.

 Whatever the case, it's a stunning achievement from two opposing forces getting together and producing something truly exceptional. Of course, T-Bone Burnett has a lot to do with realising that chemistry.

 What a way to start the weekend. Saturday morning surrounded by ear candy of the highest quality.
