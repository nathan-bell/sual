### This hefty 5 LP box was one of the finds of my recent trip up North.   
  
Id been looking for this on CD for years without much luck so jumped at the chance of owning this on premium Polyvinyl Chloride. Unfortunately, there's not a lot of great record shops left but "My Music" in Taupo was a real treasure trove where I found both this and The Slits "Cut" on brand new vinyl.   
  
To discover both hard-to-find records in the one place was simply unexpected. Jason, my new bestie, is also a real music nerd so the banter was an added bonus.    
  
When the needle dropped on this beauty, the sonics of this monster literally jumped out of the speakers. This for me is listening nirvana.  The rave on the accompanying download card states "The most blissfully blunted music the world has ever heard". I'm not arguing with this. 

 This is simply stunning!!
