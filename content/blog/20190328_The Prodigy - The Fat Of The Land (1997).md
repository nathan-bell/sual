### A few weeks ago the music world lost Keith Flint, vocal protagonist of The Prodigy.   
  
While a complete monster on stage and a savage in the studio, he was apparently one of the nicest, kindest and most thoughtful souls on planet music. While I'm not necessarily a big dance music fan, this remarkable recording is right up on the top of my all time, any genre music lists. While it hits a bit of a lull towards the end, the first 4 or 5 tracks are unmatched for shear power, gobsmackingly good production and in your face histrionics on any record I can think of.   
  
Incidentally, brother Dick left our group on the strength of me playing "Smack Your Bitch Up" at one of our Shut Up and Listen session.
