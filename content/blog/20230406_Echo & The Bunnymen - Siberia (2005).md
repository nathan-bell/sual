### Unlike the Cure's later, post 1992's "Wish" albums, the Bunnymen HAVE continued to make great records.

 While The Cure re-peddle their magnificent back catalogue, Ian McCulloch and Will Sergeant have managed to be creative and sound as fresh as those early days.

 I mention both bands in the same breathe, as they were two of my most listened to bands of the 80's and 90's.
