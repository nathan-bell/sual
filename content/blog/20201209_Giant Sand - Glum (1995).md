### I’ve been saving this. 

 This is Giant Sand’s 10th record. I bought my first, and only prior Giant Sand record, 2015’s "Heartbreak Pass", a few years ago. It was a great record. 

 This is a big noisy record that melds country twang with Norwegian Death Metal. Probably more Calexico meets full-throttle Califone but the contrasts are that extreme in places.   
  
Speaking of Calexico, Joey Burns and John Convertino who play bass and drums on this, formed Calexico a couple of years after this record.
