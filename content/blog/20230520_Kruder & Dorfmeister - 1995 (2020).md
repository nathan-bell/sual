### 1998's "The K&D Sessions" is a big 21 track, 2-hour plus, 6-LP behemoth of blissful bangers and downtempo/trip hop reworks of other artists material.

 Pretty amazing it is as well. Wall-to-wall sonic bliss. 

 These earlier and original recordings preceeded that monster and is actually their first recording of originals.
