### A randomly chosen selection this evening. Despite being four decades since their highly revered, smack-you-around-the-head trio of utter brilliance, Mr Colin Newman and Co return with a very worthy stunner that harks back to their best.

 My only gripe with this album is that the songs are so mesmeric and cathartic that I don't want them to ever stop!
