### There’s been a recent but gradual (r)evolution in my musical consumption of late, firstly with the introduction of headphones, but now taken to the next level with the purchase of a dedicated headphone DAC. 

 After being inspired by “old leather”, my old B&W headphones, I quickly appreciated the significance of opening up a whole new way of maximising my enjoyment of streaming services.

 While not the most dynamic or sonically challeging record, Psychic Ills is a fabulous way to escape into ones own head. While this setup might be deemed to be “entry level” I simply cant imagine getting much better than this.

 **Gear used:**

-  Ifi Zen DAC v2
-  B&W P7 headphones
-  Munted iPhone 8

 The evolution of my listening experience continues…
