### This record feels totally apt for these times. Bland, mechanical and repetitious. In the case of Kraftwerk - being robotic works very well. For the rest of us, it's not so good.    
  
(However in their defence and despite being an electronic collective - you wonâ€™t find a more soulful/melodious song than "The Model") 

 The present predicament we find ourselves in will change the work landscape forever.   
I'm hoping that smart people take the right approach and hurry up and slow down. Just don't let the economists and capitalist's loose to decide what the new normal looks like.
