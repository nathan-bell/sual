### Since coming out of lockdown, I've decided to take a few punts and purchase a bit of vinyl from my local "Family Jewels" record shop on the strength of reputation and Smithies recommendations. It's good to be spending local and helping out a struggling service provider ala musical therapist.   
  
This record by Australian Julia Jacklin is the first seen-but-not-heard example and as an added bonus it's on pretty orange vinyl. I've seen reference to this for a while now and it's usually up high on any "best of" lists.  

 I must say, it's a real ripper mate! I'll give it a few more listens but at this stage it certainly lives up to it's reputation.
