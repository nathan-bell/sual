### I took a bit of a gamble with my record buying this evening. It's becoming a bit of a habit lately, buying stuff I know nothing about.

 Even music/noise absurdist and non-genre specific muso-encyclopedia Smithies was unaware of this one. What we did know about The Gluts before I bought it however, was they are from Milan and on the "Fuzz Club" label.

 All I can say is "WOW WEE! (Which is a phrase I would never use in real life!) I did not expect the glorious, mind-altering, ear wormy Maelstrom that ebbs and flows throughout this beast of a record. 

 "De Witte Jager" could just play on a loop - it's a Slint/Mogwai-like churn that is mesmerising to say the least.

 Those Italians eh!.
