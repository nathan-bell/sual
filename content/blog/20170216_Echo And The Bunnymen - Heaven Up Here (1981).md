### Very recently pressed on beautiful blue vinyl.

 I got another one of my desert island discs delivered on vinyl today. While not as loud as I really wanted, (I remember reaching astounding volume when I used to play this on vinyl), it certainly sounds rich and spacious.Â 

 I really don't have to tell you how important this album is in the scheme of things. This majestic beast hasn't aged a second and still sounds more contemporary than the day I first heard it.
