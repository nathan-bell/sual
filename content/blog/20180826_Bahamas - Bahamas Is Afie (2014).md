### Fuckin' Canadians! Sarah has the TV permanently tuned to Channel 17 on Freeview. HGTV is dedicated to the very best in home improvement, DIY design, real estate and gardening - Canadian style!Â   
  
Aside from their speech impediments, Canadians are frustratingly polite and indecisive. I very rarely last 5 minutes watching these losers. I also have little interest in what they might be talking aboot.

 Now that I've got that off of my chest, I must proclaim loudly, this record by Canadian Afie Jurvanen, is one of the finds of the year. There's not a wasted moment on the whole record.  
  
This is my first listen and I am completely gobsmacked how good it is. This will definitely be on high rotation. Channel 17 I'm afraid won't be!
