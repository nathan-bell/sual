### This record seems to get a hell of a lot of hyper-praise.    
  
I've never really singled out albums in the Beatles catalogue to measure or compare against each other but in the case of this particular record, I really can't see what all the fuss is about.   
  
It's still a great record (as they all are) but in the scheme of things it's not particularly special to me. I've drawn a blank as to why I feel this way but there it is.     
  
Far more interesting to me is my complete addiction to Smoke Fairies latest gem. I've played it 6 times over the last few days.   
  
So piss off Beatles, [these babes](https://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2020/4/26/smoke-fairies-darkness-brings-the-wonders-home-2020) are my current faves.
