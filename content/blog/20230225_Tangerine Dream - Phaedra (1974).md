### **David Bowie - The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972)**

 **Tangerine Dream - Phaedra (1974)**

 I actually listened to two fabulous early 70s records this evening. They both had a huge impact on all subsequent and converging musical pathways.

 While both David Bowie and Edgar Froese are both dead, their remarkable legacies continue.

 No need to discuss Bowie's greatest but Tangerine Dream's "Phaedra" was a stunning revelation to my younger self.

 There was no escaping what was to follow.
