If you don't get goose bumps during Ronson's "Moonage Daydream" solo you are fucking deaf and probably musically bereft.

The end of "Soul Love" as it counts down into the first note of that song is also as perfect a moment on any record that I can think of.

A record that defies categorisation on any level. For this reason it will never be my favourite Bowie record or my favourite record.
