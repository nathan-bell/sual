### Another fantastic sounding remaster from 10cc's early catalogue.

 An incredibly diverse range of genres and oh so clever-Trevor-ness.  Self-referential and up it's own arse but extremely engrossing all the same. Purchased on bright yellow vinyl for a pittance.

 *Here I am a record on a jukebox, A little piece of plastic with a hole, oohPlay meBuy me and you play me then my plastic turns to goldHere we are together on your hi-fiA little piece of plastic with a hole, ohFade me, fade me, fade me, fade me*

 Lyrics from "The Worst Band In The World"
