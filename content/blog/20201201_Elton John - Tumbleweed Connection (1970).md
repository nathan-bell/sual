### From 1969's "Empty Sky" to "1976's "Blue Moves" (his last great record which I've only just began to appreciate), Elton John and Bernie Taupin produced 11 remarkable studio albums.

 Things were fairly mainstream in my early teenage years and Elton was on high rotation following "Honky Chateau" and "Don't Shoot Me..." 1973's "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" took things to another level altogether.

 I don't think I experienced David Bowie for another year when "Aladdin Sane" grabbed me by my un-forested gonads and ushered me on another journey completely. Despite that, early Elton still rules.

 This is a simply fantastic album which has finally made it into my vinyl collection.
