### Another absolute STUNNER which flew completely under the radar. 

 This debut record from French duo The Limiñanas, is one of the biggest musical surprises I have EVER encountered!!

 It's everything I love; the sounds of French 60's pop, Serge Gainsbourg, The Velvet Underground and Stereolab, all wrapped up into one psyched out fuzz monster.

 juste putain de génial
