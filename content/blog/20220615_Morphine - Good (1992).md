### Some might say that Morphine, a rowdy trio from Boston, are a bit of a one trick pony. 

 Comprising of singer/slide bass player Mark Sandman, Dana Colley on tenor and baritone sax and drummer, Jerome Dupree, it certainly feels “samey” through out. But hey, it’s a great debut record that simply highlights their unique idiosyncrasies over its entirety. 

 They’d go on to make several more good to great records before Mark Sandman died during a performance in Rome at the age of 46.
