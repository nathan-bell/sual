### This "Paradise" edition vinyl was made available in this format several years after the special edition was released on CD in 2012. I hunted this down in Melbourne a few moons ago now. 

 This adds another 8 songs to the original album and fits like a glove. I just love her rendition of "Blue Velvet" and the very decadent "Cola".     
  
Her very first record was purchased on a whim and she has not stopped wooing me over four subsequent and equally engaging records.   
  
Twin Peaks meets Californication.
