### I recently re-discovered this wonderful, satire heavy, musically rich, dignity intact record from a few decades back.

 Despite it's parody of the almighty and sacred Led Zeppelin, it works so very, very well. 

 I could easily make a brave statement here and proclaim that this is the best Elvis-sings-Led-Zeppelin-songs-in-the-style-of-Reggae-band, that ever existed.

 What is also very evident is the astonishing songs that have been lovingly been recrafted. Fully endorsed by Mr. Plant.  Glad to have it back in my collection.  “Bring it on home”
