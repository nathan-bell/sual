### This is the soundtrack to a horror film that doesn't exist. Thank God it doesn't - it would be the scariest thing you ever saw. 

 This post-quake, Christchurch band push analogue synths and found sounds to the extreme.

 The original Les Baxter was an innovator of two forms of easy listening lounge music: exotica and space age pop. A fair jazz pianist, Baxter's real strengths were as an arranger. 

 In the late 1940s, he started bringing exotic, percussion-heavy instrumentation together with lush, melodic strings and elements of big band swing.
