### **Live:    Steven Wilson - Wednesday 26/10/2016 - The Powerstation, Auckland**

 Holy Shit! What a dream! VIP passes to Steven Wilson's astounding 3 hour show for me and my boy.

 I made a pact about 5 years ago with Peter that ANY opportunity we had to see Steven Wilson or Porcupine Tree live we would not hesitate to go. We were both huge fans over many years. That very situation arose at the beginning of 2016 when I quickly snapped up 2 VIP Gold tickets. 

 Early entry to the venue, a backstage pass for an hour long Q&A session with SW and then the pinch me, "are we really here?" moment. Yes, we really did make it!

 And what an amazing, breath-taking gig. It's metal, it's prog, it's psychedelic, it's jazz. It's right up there with my favourite gigs of all time. Something really special to share with the lad.
