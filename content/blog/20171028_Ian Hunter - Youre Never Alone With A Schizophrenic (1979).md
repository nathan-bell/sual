### Mick Ronson's best mate's classic late 70's masterpiece.  
(Ian Hunter was band leader of Mott The Hoople)

 I bought this amidst all of the punk and new wave I was being bombarded with at the time on the strength of the Ronson/Hunter partnership.Â  Mick Ronson is all over this and lends a hand with production, guitar and vocals.

 It's the first time in about 40 years I've listened to it but can remember every song like it was yesterday. It's a cracker!

 Bought a 4 CD box set (From The Knees Of My Heart) from TWH for $7 containing the remastered version of YNAWAS plus his next studio album and 2 live gigs. Brilliant!
