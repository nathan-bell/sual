### You know what? Lorde gets cooler by the day. There's a wonderful [recent interview](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-844-lorde) with her on the "WTF" podcast series with Marc Maron, where she raves about her favourite artist of all time, Peter Green. Marc Maron is also a huge fan and the nerdy discussion the follows makes you realise that this girl in truly legit. It's just brilliant banter.

 By the way, if you get the chance, have a listen to some great interviews. He's one of the best.  [WTF - Podcast Website](http://www.wtfpod.com/)

 Any hows, I don't have to tell you how brilliant Mr. Green is, especially his Fleetwood Mac days. Still one of my greatest finds ever, this 4 CD anthology is just sensational.
