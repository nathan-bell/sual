### Stephen McBean, front man and guitarist of the fabulous Black Mountain, takes a trippy diversion with offshoot band, Pink Mountaintops.

 Fuzzed-out guitars, a wonderfully swampy, lo-fi production and wonky vocals makes for a real treat. None of its 7 tracks are remotely similar but all equally enjoyable.

 Not bad for $2.95 at Real Groovy Records.
