### I'm just thinking - I started my 12 year "career" at my current work place soon after this was released. Now that's just crazy! (By the way - it's the longest work stint I've ever had by a long shot)

 It just doesn't seem possible that this gem is that old. The Tree broke up in 2010(ish) and that Wilson fella went off on his lone crusade.

 "Fear of A Blank Planet" and this EP "Nil Recurring" (left over tracks recorded at the same session) could possibly be their high water mark. It's pretty well faultless.

 The track "Normal" is a progressive, folk-metal masterpiece.
