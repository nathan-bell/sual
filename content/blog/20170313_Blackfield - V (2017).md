### I hated this when it first came out on Tidal. Very average to my ears and I just about gave up on it. After persevering with it over the last couple of weeks, I have warmed to it completely - finally splashing out on the CD/BD version. 

 Aviv Geffen's vocals still grate a bit but the sweeping, melodic/melancholic sounds are very appealing indeed. He's a great song writer though - just a pity he has to sing it.  
Just let Steven Wilson do all of the vocals along with his brilliant guitar work and it would be a complete masterpiece.
