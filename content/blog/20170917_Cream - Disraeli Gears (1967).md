### I remember seeing Cream's farewell concert on the goggle box back in the early to mid 70's. It was fairly brutal stuff that really didn't hold that much interest for me.

 Unlike seeing Thin Lizzy's Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson's twin guitar assault live on TV or a bit later, Space Waltz performing "Out On The Street" on some poxy talent show, this was not a WTF moment.

 I'm not sure why but Clapton always gave me a dose. I still can't stand the man and the muscian - totally over rated.

 OK there's a few good songs on this lot, but I'm afraid, it's not ripping my nightie at all.
