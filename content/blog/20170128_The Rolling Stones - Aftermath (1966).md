### When TWH has one of it's big vinyl sales, you betcha there's some goodies to be found. Ranging in price from $9.98 to $20, I ended up with some great vinyl from Love, The Band, Depeche Mode, The Vaccines, The Magic Numbers and this gem from the Stones. I've been meaning to own this for years and vowing not to buy other digital formats, this was just begging to be grabbed without hesitation. And what a goodie it is!!

 This is the Stones first "proper" record of orginals and it's a treat from start to finish.

 I sort of missed out on the early Stones material, my first exposure was "Goats Head Soup" and "Sticky Fingers", so I'm enjoying discovering them all over again.
