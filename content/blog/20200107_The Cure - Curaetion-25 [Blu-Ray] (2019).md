### Stunning new film of The Cure playing live in 2018. As well as being stunning visually, the Cures have never sounded better.  
  
As heavy as fuck, advice on the packaging states very clearly "These shows were played loud - so please turn it up".Â  At one point my iWatch notified me of the risk of hearing loss - what a fucking nana!   
  
40 years on, The Cure are a band I never tire of.
