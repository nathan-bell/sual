### I've been waiting a long time to find this record. This is the first (proper) record by Tuscon, Arizona duo Trees Speak.

 Prolific over the last few years, they have produced another 3 great records since this one.

 While there's a banjo to be found deep in one track, you couldn't get further away in sound from the country twang of redneck USA.

 It's all analogue synths and there's a distinct Krautrock/Tangerine Dream feel. It's refreshingly old school.
