### I flipped an "N" on my randomiser. With less than a dozen artists to choose from I went for the midling and picked New Order's forth record.

 Sounding a bit dated and (as with certain other 80's recordings) rather "flat". Not a lot of dynamic range to say the least. Not awful by any stretch but hardly engaging.  
Joy Division, in complete contrast is something that does stand the test of time. This is a bit of a mess.
