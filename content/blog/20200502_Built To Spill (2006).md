### OK, I've never been a big fan of Old Cranky throughout his musical lifespan.   
  
With the exception of his early days with CSN&Y, "On The Beach" "Zuma" and "Arc-Weld", I've mainly stayed clear of his guitar and song-writing histrionics.    
  
This Boisean band from Idaho, are the epitome of what's great about the Neil Young I like. The passion, the intensity, the voice and "that tone" when he does hit the good notes and doesn't go on for a fucking eternity.    
  
This is chock to the brim with fantastic songs honouring dirty old rock 'n' roll.   
  
While they are too good to be just Neil Young lite, they do honour the master on the wonderful "live" album from 2000 where they do an absolute stonking version of "Cortez The Killer".
