### There's a scene in the Sopranos, I don't know what season, yet alone what episode, but someone gets whacked around the head with a telephone at the "Badda Bing" club. (It's Series 1, Episode 2 actually)

 In the background there's a track playing from this record - "Battle Flag" by Pigeonhead. It's still a fantastic track but aside from that it truly epitomises the astounding soundtrack that played out in each episode of that landmark series.

 I'm not sure what came before "The Sopranos" but for me that show was pivotal for me in taking the humble TV show to a whole new level.
