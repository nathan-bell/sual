### 1998's "The Gathering" was a musical event I would never have contemplated ever attending, unless I was serving up curries to the masses.

 It just so happens that this opportunity did present itself - helping a mate sell vegetarian and chicken curries up Kanaan Downs. 

 During the spare time I did have, I mingled with punters at party central and when that got too much, chilled in the more introspecitve, ambient nooks.

 I have fond memories. This wonderful record brings back those memories.

 In March 2023, this record received Independent Music NZâ€™s Classic Record award, part of the Taite Music Prize 2023.
