### The big news of the day was the passing of guitar maestro and personal hero, Jeff Beck.

 I chose not to spend the evening playing his music but did play a couple of tracks earlier in the day.

 So here we have a completely unrelated choice, but no less revered, the wonderful XTC.

 This newly cut, re-mastered record sounds amazing. Pressed on beautiful 200g black vinyl, I've never heard this sound so crystal clear and hefty.

 "This World Over" remains a poignant reminder.
