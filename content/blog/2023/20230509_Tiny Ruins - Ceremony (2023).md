### I just love it when you can hear the strings rattle on the frets and actually feel the reach of the singer's breath.

 Hollie Fullbrook's new Tiny Ruins album, which I'm currently streaming, has probably gone to the top of my "must-get-on-vinyl" list.

 It's been a while since I've been so instantly smitten by a record on first listen.
