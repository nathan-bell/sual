### Here’s yet another fantastic band from Melbourne. Several recent favourites of the last few years have come from this town.

 Duo Zoë Randell and Steve Hassett have breached their folky ways and delivered a rich, cinematic experience far removed from the traditional acoustic fare.

 The track “Sculptor” is magnificent.
