### Bob Stanley & Pete Wiggs Present English Weather.

 The autumnal sound of Britain at the turn of the 70's, looking out through wet wind panes to a new decade with a mixture of melancholy and optimism to what might come next.

 Jump forward 50 oddd years to good old New Zealand and there's a familiarity to those sentiments.

 As with all of Paul Stanley's compilations (he's a cracking author as well) the track listing is wonderfully eclectic. 

 Speaking of eclectic, playlists, check out [RNZ's Nashville Babylon. 6:04pm Saturdays on RNZ](https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/nashville-babylon)
