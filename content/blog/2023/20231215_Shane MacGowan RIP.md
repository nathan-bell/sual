> Shane MacGowan (25 December 1957 – 30 November 2023)

Shane MacGowan and the Pogues were are a favourite of my Step-dad (who had a big influence on my musical tastes), and have always been important to me.

It looks like he had a great send-off - here is Nick Cave performing "Rainy Night in Soho" at his funeral.
