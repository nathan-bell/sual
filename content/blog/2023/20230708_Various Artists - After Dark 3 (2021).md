### This Triple LP pressing, on hefty purple vinyl, is a compilation of "Italians Do It Better" label artists.

 It oozes effortless cool from every groove. On 45rpm vinyl, its ridiculous bottom end is made for the dance floor. 

 Not just any old dance floor however, the "Bang Bang Bar" at "The Roadhouse" of Twin Peaks.

 In actuality, The Chromatics, who have a couple of tracks on this record, did appear on episode 2 of "Twin Peaks, The Return".
