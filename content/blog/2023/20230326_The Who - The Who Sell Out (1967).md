### This 2022 half-speed-mastered, repress of The Who's 3rd record sounds ridiculously good. Entwistle's bass guitar especially comes to the fore but there's amazing staging of all instruments.

 I was completely sceptical at first but wow - this is spectacular!

 As the garb says "*this record was cut using a specialist technique known as half-speed mastering.*

 *This artisan process results in cuts that have superior high frequency response (treble) and very solid and stable stereo images.*"

 You better believe it!
