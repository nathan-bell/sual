### Soundtrack from the Guillaume Podrovnik Documentary.

 It's Record Store Day (RSD). Translation = an overhypered, completely contrived day to celebrate the market-induced scarcity and fleecing of fully suspecting vinyl buying punters.

 Despite this cynicism, it's the Liminanas aint it! With only 400 copies worldwide, how could I resist.
