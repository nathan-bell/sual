### This record is so refreshingly old school. 

 Like similarly discordant outliers, Sonic Youth, it's a messy, chunky but palatable goulash.

 Most agreeablely dished up on re-cycled blue vinyl.

 There's a fabulous trick, that's exclusive to vinyl, where the end of side two loops for infinity.

 It's a drone I could listen to forever (and nearly did). 

 Ira Kaplan's guitar on "This Stupid World" is particularly angry. "This stupid world. It's all we have!"
