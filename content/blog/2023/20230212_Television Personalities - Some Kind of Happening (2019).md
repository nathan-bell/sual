### Singles 1978 to 1989.

 At times abrasively authentic, at other times delicately ridiculous, this rough and ready collection presents a quirky collection of non-album tracks and singles.

 The TPs hail from London and these 38 tracks of inventive, punk-leaning, pop songs are as English as a buttered muffin and a cup of tea.

 Big influencers on bands Pavement and Jesus and the Mary Chain, it's hard not to see why. Lubbly dubbly.
