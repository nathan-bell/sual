### This recording is as close to improvisational "free" jazz as I'm willing to ever venture. Can never just play their last record, they deconstruct, reconstruct or completely destroy it at every opportunity.

 This (far too) short recording captures a remarkable group of musicians in don't-give-a-flying-fuck mode. There are some astonishing moments but unfortunately I feel short changed.
