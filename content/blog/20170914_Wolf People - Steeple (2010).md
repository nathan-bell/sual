### Any band that recycles the mighty Tull, flutes and all, better get away with it.

 While more an amalgam of everything 70's, guitar riffs, long hair and flairs - it's no gimmick.

 These Bedordians have obviously been stranded by time and location and have drunk extensively from the sacred waters of the Great Ouse.Â 

 An absolute gem of the record - from start to finish. Do yourself a favour and listen to this. You won't stop smiling.
