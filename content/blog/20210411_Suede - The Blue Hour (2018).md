### Brett Anderson's voice is the main instrument I crave for when listening to any Suede record and this is especially the case with his more mellow solo records. This is a full tilt Suede record.

 While there's a hint of Ziggy/Aladdin Sane era Bowie in his timbre it's distinctly and authentically his own.

 As with all good Suede records, and I can't really think of a bad one, it will continue to grow and grow in appeal after each subsequent listens.

 The last 3 "comeback" records have exceeded all expectations.
