### This absolutely beautiful album was lent to me several year ago and I have never been able to track it down since. I tried not giving it back/stealing it to no avail.

 The CDR copy I'm playing sounds fantastic, and would probably do, but I long to have my own copy. The music simply deserves better.

 These four dudes, who sound awfully like Icelanders, are from Bethesda in Wales - the same town where Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals) comes from.

 Criminally underrated. Magnificent, ethereal, otherworldly does not do it justice.
