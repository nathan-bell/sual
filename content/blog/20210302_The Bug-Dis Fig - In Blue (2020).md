### While missing some of the confrontational intensity of "London Zoo" this brilliant slab of blue vinyl continues to shatter expectations on this very first listen.

 Some of it reminds me of the best bits of side one of Massive Attack's phenomenal "Mezzanine" combined with the vocals of Tricky's guest vocalist Martina Topley-Bird. In this case it's Dis Fig doing the honours.

 The sound-forms, percussive elements and rich textures are simply extraordinary. This might also challenge your stereo system.
