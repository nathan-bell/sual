### A fantastic post-Bauhaus compilation of Daniel Ash's side project prior to establishing the equally wonderful Love & Rockets.

 Like some Ziggy Stardust/Mick Ronson clone, Daniel Ash exudes the combination of squalling guiter slinger and crooning frontman.

 The whole family tree of Bauhaus, Tones On Tail and Love & Rockets is worth exploring for a wealth of fantastic post punk pop of the finest quality.

 They deserved better.
