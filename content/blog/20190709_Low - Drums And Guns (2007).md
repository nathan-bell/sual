### This record just shouldn't work. News Flash: Low, the protagonists of slowcore, embrace abrasive percussive elements and discordant organ textures. 

 What it does uphold though, is the wonderful solo and harmonised voices of Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker. 

 I'm constantly in awe of the myriad different ways they continue to raise their high water mark. It's a fucking tsunami on this one.

 I can't believe this has been around for 12 years!!!!!
