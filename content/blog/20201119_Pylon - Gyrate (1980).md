### This is actually my very first listen to this highly revered, post punk band from Athens, Georgia (now hasn't that been in the news lately?!) 

 And this will definitely not be my last. This is possibly (I might have said this before) one of my greatest ever first auditions of any recording in history.

 There is not one wasted sound across 11 brilliantly abrasive and twitchy tracks.   
  
I'm straight off to order their 4 LP box set "Pylon Box". It ain't cheap, but it will be worth every penny.

 Since my initial audition I have listened to this record four times. I've hardly blinked since!
