### I'm really not sure what attracted me to this, aside from the beautiful cover, but what a fantastic find.

 Like a few days lately, I've been finding a few unfamiliar tracks and albums via streaming services.

 Tonight it was a sample of Trees Speak (vinyl on order - it's brilliant), Unkle (saw them at the Big Day Out many moons ago and was blown away (Robin I - sounds brilliant) and then this.

 I just had to play the whole recording as I was totally taken in by it's poppy, dreamy, distorted brilliance. A peach of a record.
