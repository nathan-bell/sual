### Affectionately known as the "Countdown Album" (let's face it, it flows off the tongue a lot easier than "10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1"), this absolute stonker from the Oils is one of the great records of the 80s.

 Also without doubt one of the best gigs I EVER saw was Midnight Oil at the Palmerston North Sports Stadium the same year of this release.

 Today, this record sounds as essential as ever. While always overtly political this album simply kicks ass.
