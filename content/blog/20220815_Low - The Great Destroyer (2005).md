### Another faultless record from these Duluth-based, slow-core pioneering Mormons. (Incidentally, Duluth was also the birth place of one Robert Zimmerman).

 Recently picked up by Sub Pop records this is a major leap forward in instrumental layering and accessibility. Not a great move for some Low purists but great to these ears.

 Beautifully pressed across two solid slabs of vinyl.
