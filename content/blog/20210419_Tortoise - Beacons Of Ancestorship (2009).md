### Some of this reminds me a bit of Herbie Hancock and the robotic dancing legs of "Rockit.   
Thereâ€™s some serious funky jazz going on here. 

 The tracks do meander a bit sometimes and could do with some vocal relief at times just to mix things up.

 However, if you're in the mood for some relentless alt-funk, then this is for you.
