### **Live: Thursday 20th March 1980, Athletic Park, Wellington.**

 Six months after the release of "Tusk", The Mac had an infamous melt down on stage at Athletic Park.

 While probably too naive to remember witnessing the dynamics of this, I did think to myself that the teenyboppers and middle-aged trendies who came to see this would have hated it. This was not a "pop" event. Lindsey Buckingham's version of Peter Green's "Oh Well" quickly saw to that. A big messy stonker of a set. Rock'n'Roll at it's best and worst.
