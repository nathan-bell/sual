### When you add the calibre of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois to proceedings you just know it's special.

 This instrumental album, showcasing some very impressive processed guitar playing and harmonics, borrows from a myriad of influences. Spanish, Spagetti Western, Middle Eastern and ambient.

 I loved this 25 years ago but god knows what I was listening to back then? It's such a non-conforming, left field relic?

 Best Track(s): Ultramarine, Urbana
