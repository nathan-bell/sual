### One of the most astounding debut records ever, The Bunnymen were like a breath of fresh air at a time of unprecedented musical diversification.  
  
For me personally, the early 80's was a seriously confusing time with multiple forks in the musical crossroads. While their next record "Heaven Up Here" was my starting point, and still highly revered, they were a huge influence on the eventual path I would take.  
  
No band in recent times has influenced me more than this band. "Heaven Up Here" my third choice "Big Three" record will now concede to my forth choice. As Chris said the other evening "Crocodiles" and "Heaven Up Here" are inseparable.Â
