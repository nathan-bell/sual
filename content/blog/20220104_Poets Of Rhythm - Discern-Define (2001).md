### The more I dig into German music of the last 50 or so years, the more I am blown away.

 This outrageously great funk record sounds like it belongs back in the 70's but with today's state-of-the-art production it's unmistakably contemporary. Nothing made 50 years ago could sound this good.

 The soundstage is huge, the bass is deep and the slightly off-kilter, full-on, big band instrumentation just makes everything sound so massive.

 This is simply wonderful. Give your turntable and stereo a complete workout with this gem.

 Smithies thrust this into my hands at the end of last year. Like some sinister drug dealer he's got me completely hooked. Again!
