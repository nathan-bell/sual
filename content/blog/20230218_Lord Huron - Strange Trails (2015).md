### A very easy choice tonight. When you are out walking and the dog makes a bee line for a young American woman wearing a Lord Huron "Long Lost" T Shirt, there's a clear message there.

 It was just as much a surprise to her being confronted by some old git proclaiming that they recognised the obscure band displayed across her chest. 

 While not getting too philosophical about things, it was a moment in time and space where two people, generations and cultures apart, ticked the mutual appreciation box. Music does that sometimes.

 This is Lord Huron's second album. As with all of their records, there's not a wasted note to be found.
