### What’s the first album you play on your brand new turntable? One of the most iconic records of all time - that’s what!   
  
While it’s certainly not my favourite Beatles album, it’s a great reference record. Most of the tunes aren’t too bad either.

 While it took a bit of fiddling to set up the deck, tweaking the counter-weight, apply anti-skating and adjusting dials and knobs, it was revelatory to say the least. (it’s a Pro-ject 2xperience SB by the way with walnut plinth to keep the wife happy)  
  
I’ve never heard this record sounding so good.
