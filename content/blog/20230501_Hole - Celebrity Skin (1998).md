### Hole's second record, 1994's "Live Through This" remains one of my top album contenders across any genre.

 While it's peak grunge, it still has one of the highest, and surely not legal, quotas of hooks possible on a single record.

 Wild child, Courtney Love's vitriolic vocals certainly help make it great.

 This record comes a few years later when grunge had fallen back to earth.

 This is a proper rock record with Billy Corgan now lending a hand and co-writing many of the songs.

 While its not even close to that earlier album, there are many great moments. "Malibu" is Hole's most popular song.
