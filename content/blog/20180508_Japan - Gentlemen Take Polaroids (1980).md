### [Original 1980 Japanese pressing from Lo Cost Vinyl in Jackson Street, Petone]

 I just spent the weekend in Wellington and restricted my purchases (with the utmost of restraint I must say!) to just four items. Now that's a minor miracle.

-  Japan “Gentlemen Take Polaroids” (vinyl)
-  Gary Numan “Splinter” (CD)
-  Porcupine Tree “Deadwing” (vinyl)
-  Jethro Tull “Living In The Past” (vinyl)

 I also realised while listening to this record that all of those bands/artists I recently acquired are quite closely linked to each other.

-  Gary Numan recorded with Mick Karn of Japan
-  Richard Barbieri was a member of Japan AND Porcupine Tree
-  Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree has remastered many of Jethro Tull’s records.

 Today I also secured two pre-sale tickets to see Steven Wilson’s three hour extravaganza in Auckland on November 12th. Well bugger me it’s a mixed up, connected old world.
