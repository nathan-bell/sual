### A mid-eighties gem of a record.

 This record single singlehandedly moved The Cure away from the dirgy, gloomy (but brilliant) haze of Smith's earlier vociferation.

 They became true popsters without any loss of credibility. The goths still worshiped them. As dramatic Led Zep turning into ABBA I suppose?

 Bought on vinyl this very day for 25 bucks. Partly inspired by last night's Shut Up and Listen Session (Bruce's "Just Like Heaven").
