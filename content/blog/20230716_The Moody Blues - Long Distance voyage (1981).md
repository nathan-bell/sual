### I picked up this rather nice, vinyl re-press for bugger-all back when The Warehouse was a proper pot pouri of un-loved and abandoned musical media.

 If you spent enough time at regular but frequent intervals, there was every chance you'd score some goodies.

 While I was never a big fan of the Moodies, this is surprisingly engaging with some great musical moments throughout. 

 It's always good to mix things up with some good old-fashioned Dad Rock. It certainly counters musical snobbery and arrogance.
