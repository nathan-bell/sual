### Being sandwiched between "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" and "Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy" doesn't help.

 To me, "Caribou" it was just another great Elton John record which I enjoyed as much as the others. Back in those days we didn't really judge or rate records - we just listened.

 Even the critically fan panned "Solar Prestige A Gammon" sounds good to these ears. You really had to be there.
