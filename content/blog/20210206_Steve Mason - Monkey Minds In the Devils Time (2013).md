### This is Steve Mason's third album since leaving one of Scotland's finest turn-of-this-century musical ensembles, The Beta Band.

 He simply carries on where he left off with the same brilliant toe tappingly good, ultra-melodious allegories.

 One of the many standout tracks "Fight Them Back" is his interpretation of the 2011 capital riots in the UK.

 "You get up and fight them back! A fist, a boot and and baseball bat". 

 While there are elements of thuggery, in the wider context it couldn't be a more timely diatribe on religion, politics and capitalism.
