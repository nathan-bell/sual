### I wasn't much of a Pretenders fan really, but their first record is an absolute stunner and totally vinyl worthly. (when it's $25 on newly minted vinyl at TWH it's a no brainer!)

 As a 20 year old, post-punk, new wave-loving young person, this was the bee's knees! This came out of nowhere but quickly became a high rotation game changer.

 Very much ahead of it's time and a true rock'n'roll classic.
