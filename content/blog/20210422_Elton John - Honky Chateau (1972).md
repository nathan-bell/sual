### Before my tastes became a little more eclectic and sophisticated, I was an Elton John obsessive.

 This holds some fantastic memories and remains a cracking good record. It's a great collection of brilliant songs that for consistency was never bettered on subsequent albums.

 This new 2017 re-pressing just sounds fantastic.
