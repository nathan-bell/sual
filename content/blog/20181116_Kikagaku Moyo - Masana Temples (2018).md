### I possibly heard about this record while listening to the "All Songs Considered" podcast on one of my mindful(less) walks.

 It was one of those WTF moments where you stop in your tracks and take note of who and what before it's all lost. That happens a lot these days.

 Anyhow, this is on high rotation and warrants repeated listens. It's Japanese Psych-Kraut rock at it's best.
