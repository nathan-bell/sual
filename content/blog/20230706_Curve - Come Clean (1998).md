### Take Massive Attack's "Mezzanine", give it a bit more edge ala The Prodigy, then add Toni Halliday's calm but devastating vocals into the mix.

 Think Shirely Manson on very strong steroids. This might prepare you for the onslaught.

 If you can stay the distance this is a remarkable ride. Altough its 25 years old, it's a reminder when music packed an almighty punch.
