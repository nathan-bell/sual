### This beautiful album follows the magnificent "Souvlaki", a record that Brian Eno provided keyboards and treatments. While the Eno ambience wasn't obvious on that, it's right to the fore on this.

 The first track, "Rutti" is 10 minutes of glorious, reverb-rich, guitar minimalism that I'd be happy if it lasted the entire record.  It's mesmerising in the same way that Paddy McAloon's 'I Trawl the Megahertz" enthralls.   
Thankfully the rest of the album is just as staggering.
