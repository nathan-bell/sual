 I had a bit of a sneaky listen last night to the re-released, remastered proper version of "Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea".   
  
Incidentally, I had my CD version of this record "borrowed" a decade or so ago (thanks Jae!) so haven't listened to it since then. It is a sensational record.   
  
This LP I'm listening to this evening is the full album with the same track listing but recorded as the demo versions. While the production values are clearly missing, the quality of the songwriting still shines through.
