### Dropped in for a beer at The Free House this afternoon with my lovely wife Sarah and son Peter. Coincidentally, a "Black Vinyl Brown Beer" record fair was in full swing in the yurt. It was only manners to venture in and have a gander.

 I picked up this beauty (In pristine, hardly, if at all, played condition) and also picked up a similarly immaculate copy of Curve's "Cuckoo".

 The Creatures were a side project of Siouxsie Sioux and Budgie from the Banshees. This is the high point in their recorded output and is simply stunning. Purchase price was $10. 

 The wonderful cover and insert would be worth the price alone. The fact that it sounds just brilliant is a big bonus - what a buy!!
