### For various reasons, I felt a little nostalgic this evening. 

 Before Bowie and T-Rex came along, Elton was my goto artist. It was his “Don’t Shoot Me..” and this earlier record that hooked me completely. 

 Hey, I was 13 years old but to be fair evolving to be somewhat musically discerning.

 This Bob Ludwig mastered, Abbey Road-cut vinyl recording remastered in 2017 sounds ridiculously good tonight.
