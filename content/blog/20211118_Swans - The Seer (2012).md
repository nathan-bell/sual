### This is a CD I have always been very reluctant (aka being really frightened) to play. 

 I mean Ray Haliburtonâ€™s Allmusic User Review from 2015 proclaims "...if you're looking for music that is truly horrifying, visceral, epic and absorbing, step right up."

 Bought nearly two decades ago and played for the very first time today. Thirty minutes into this 2 hour epic (I'm sure I'll only cope with half tonight) its proving to be a truly absorbing and unavoidably jolting experience.

 Frightening, yes. Remarkable, truly but simply unsustainable. I could pretend I love it - that would be the cool thing to do. Recommended in small doses only.
