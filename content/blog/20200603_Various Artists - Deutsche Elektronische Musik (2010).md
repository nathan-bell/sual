### Soul Jazz Records Presents: Experimental German Rock and Electronic Musik 1972-1983 (Record A)    
  
Another absolutely FANTASTIC compilation from Soul Jazz Records.  I don't know what was in the water on the Hinterland around this time, but Fick Mich, what an absolute stonker of a record.   
  
There's an abundance of creativity, unbridled streams of consciousness (the antithesis of the stoic, self conscious post-war German?) and as you would expect, impeccable application.      
  
While it's only half of the 2x CD version, it's designated "Record A", it sounds all the better over 4 sides of vinyl. I'm going to hunt down "Record B" as there's simply no going back to digital shiny plastic.
