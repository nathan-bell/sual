### Heard a great song on the way home from work today by kiwi band "Supermodel". It reminded me a lot of Prefab Sprout. As soon as I heard it, I thought "That's what I'll play tonight!" So I did.

 This album, "Jordan The Comeback" by the sprouts, was huge in our household during the early 90's when the kiddies were tiny tots and life was simple. This was not your average crooning Geordie band but a soundtrack to our world at the time. 

 I'm keen to find out more about "Supermodel". It certainly fired up my synapses today.

 Best track: The song "The Wedding March" is brilliant. George Gershwin eat your heart out.
