### Just when I thought it was safe to abandon a proper stereo system for a look, no-hands, wireless streaming service-centric solution, I get sucked right back in! 

 A relatively easy task of picking up a wall mount for my new Sonos Beam at the Harvey Norman big barn turned into an adventure in re-focus and concession. 

 I've dreamed of owning a pair of beautiful, hand-made Theophany speakers and there right in front of me, that dream was finally realised. 

 Always out of my price range - today they were selling for less than half their normal price! 

 I am now the proud owner of two little (in size, but not in sound) Theopany Epithany Katharos floor standing speakers.

 This was the first album I picked to have a proper listen. And what a sensational experience it was.
