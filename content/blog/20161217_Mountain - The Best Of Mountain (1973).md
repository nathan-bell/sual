### $15 at TWH buys a big slab of Mountain on vinyl at the peak of their career. I'd pay a lot more just to have a pristine version of "Mississippi Queen" on analogue.

 The aforementioned song is most definitely the champion of all songs utilising a cow bell. Incidently, it is well documented (legend has it anyway) that any rock song that utilises a real cow bell is a sure hit.

 While "Mississippi Queen" is the star, the other material is pretty damn fine as well.
