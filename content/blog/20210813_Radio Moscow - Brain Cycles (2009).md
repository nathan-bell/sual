### These hairy MFs from Ames, Iowa really know how to kick the barn doors down!

 While it hints at stoner rock at times, it's more in the flavour of the heavy side of 70's electric blues. Somehow it's magically crafted in the studio by a humble two piece. Parker Griggs on guitar AND drums, and Zach Anderson on bass.

 Fortunately, they hire a drummer when going on tour.
