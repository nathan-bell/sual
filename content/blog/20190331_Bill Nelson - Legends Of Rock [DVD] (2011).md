### Fantastic live set with his band "The Gentlemen Rocketeers" in front of a very small select audience at the Metropolis Studios in London back in 2011.

 If you haven't heard of Bill Nelson you will not be alone. He was front man and guitarist with Be Bop Deluxe (which included Kiwi Charles Tumahai) back in the mid to late 70's. 

 He's been prolific ever since but always well under the mainstream radar. He's a fine guitar player and this is highlighted in the fantastic DVD.

 What's also fascinating is the array of weird guitars he plays. [Vintage Guitar Article](https://www.vintageguitar.com/18051/bill-nelson/)

 A Campbell Nelsonic signature model, an Eastwood Wandre Tri-Lam, a Peerless Deep Blue Custom, Hallmark Stradette and an Eastwood California Rebel are several examples.
