### Stunning debut from the kings of goth!

 Opening with the incomparible "Double Dare", which I first experienced as a 20 year old, it absolutely jolted me to the core!

 Daniel Ash, who incidently worshiped Mick Ronson at the time, became an instant guitar hero of mine. Like shards of glass, his riffy/scratchy fret work tore up any rule book. Just listen to "Stigmata Martyr" and "Nerves".  

 Pete Murphy just scared the bejesus out of me. A cross between a lizard-like Bowie/Iggy and Linda Blair's Regan MacNeil.  

 A huge record in my scheme of things. Once Pete Murphy had left the building they went on to form the wonderful Love and Rockets.
