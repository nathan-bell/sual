### One of the more uplifting RHP records. While it's really just another Mark Kozelek solo project, it sounds like a proper band.

 Regarded by critics as his best album, it's far more accessible than most his other challenging and melancholic meanderings. 

 Sometimes I wonder why I ever listen to anything Mark Kozelek, but I always go back for more.
