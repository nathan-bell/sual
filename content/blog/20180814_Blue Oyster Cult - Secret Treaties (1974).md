### Early 70's music doesn't get much more inventive than this. A biggie record for me from undoubtedly the most fertile of musical eras.  
  
This has hints of punk and new wave well before that upcoming shit storm suffocated the dinosaurs and led me on an extraordinary path towards total musical non-conformity. As a result I remain continually in search of my next fix.  
  
Listening today it's still hard to define. One thing is for sure, it had a huge impact on how I listened. It's not quite musical nirvana but fucking close. (Richard, I'm still searching!)
