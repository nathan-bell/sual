### **Vinyl**

 Picked this up during a very quick trawl of the vinyl racks at TWH. A double album for 1 cent shy of 20 bucks! This was recorded back in the very early days of his big come back at the turn of this century.

 It's a great show that also showcases the great Jennifer Batten on guitar. He's always liked the ladies in his band.

 There's a wonderful version of "A Day In The Life". It's probably the best version I've heard. "Delcan" also gives me goose bumps.

 Another great find.
