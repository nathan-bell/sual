### I knew absolutely nothing about this particular gatefold sleeved, double CD wedged amongst the boxes of unloved discs sitting under the big "clearance" sign.

 Like some long abandoned puppy, desperate to find someone who cared one iota to pay attention, it caught my attention. At first thinking it was a Christian record, (the cover's just a bit naff), I googled on my phone and only saw positive reviews.

 For $4.98 it was unlikely to propel one into financial hardship so I took my chance. (I also found Bowie's stage show soundtrack "Lazarus" and Imelda May's great T.Bone Burnett-produced "Life. Love. Flesh. Blood", for a similar pittance.

 The first CD (Gentle) which I am listening to tonight, is a lovely folky, rock experience rich in orchestration and gorgeous vocals provided by the great Dutch singer [Anneke van Giersbergen](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/anneke-van-giersbergen-mn0000719142) 

 One listen is not going to do it justice. All I can say it's far from unpleasant and will need a couple a plays to fully appreciate.
