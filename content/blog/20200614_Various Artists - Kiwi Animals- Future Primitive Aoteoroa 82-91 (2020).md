### I was prepared to get very uncomfortable with this brand new compilation of "forgotten New Zealand electronic and avante music of the 1980s" released in late May this year. 

Granted, it is indeed a challenging listen in places but as I alluded to last month  I'm tending towards the non-mainstream, potpourri approach to my listening. It's just getting too comfortable otherwise.   

There are some astoundingly great left field tracks on this timely, post-covid release. Like recent events, we all need a shake up!
