### On Vinyl (Remastered 2016)

 One of my favourite Bowie records - this REALLY takes me back.

 As a barely-teenager, I was really starting to get completely obsessed with the whole alien freak thing and happened to win this on a local radio promotion. I couldn't get on my bike fast enough.

 While this was panned by many, there's some astounding songs, especially Sweet Thing, Rebel Rebel, Rock 'n Roll With Me and We Are The Dead. In fact nothing falls short in my view. 

 I only realised recently that Bowie played all of the crunchy guitars on this. Ronson was long gone by then.
