### The CD strikes back saga continues. I'm truly blown away by a few recent revelations that have now been fully implemented with spectacular results.

 Here are my findings:

 1. Don't get rid of your CDs and other digital media. I'm re-loving all of mine.

 2. Do not spend more than you need on a CD transport. It's the DAC that does the heavy lifting. In my case I'm using a [Sony UDP-X700 Blu-ray](https://www.whathifi.com/au/sony/ubp-x700/review) bought dirt cheap and connected by coaxial cable to my Cambridge Audio CXN V2 or NAD C700).

 3. Do your research - YouTube is great. You will truly appreciate the great advice and save a bundle on unnecessary overhyped solutions.

 You would not believe how punchy and revealing this Enigma album sounds. Digital media in this household has never sounded so good.

 Here endeth my sermon.
