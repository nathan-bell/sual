### Progressive folk at its finest. Don't expect any real song structure, just one long, meandering, multilayered, highly complex, electro-acoustic folk jam.

 Its rather disconcerting at first, but demands many listens to consider it properly. 

 While you could compare Grizzly Bear to Fleet Foxes, Midlake or mid-late Yo La Tengo, they probably have more in common with Radiohead. 

 Not the easiest listen and not a record you would reach for often but a record that will reward with subsequent listens.
