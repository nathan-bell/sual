### I spilt my coffee all over my desk at work and into my back pack this black Friday morning. Coincidence, not really - shit happens sometimes and I was a fuck wit for being so careless.  
  
It was a great day aside from that moment and luck has definitely been on my side in regards to the hard earnt cash spent on 20 or so el cheapo compact discs lining the CD racks at The Warehouse. (Just a tad over $50 all up last count).  
  
Every album has been revelational so far with a couple in the "astounding" category. This recording by ace producer Emile Haynie (Eminem, Ghostface Killah, Kayne West) includes guest spots by Lana Del Rey, Brian Wilson, Randy Newman and Colin Blunstone. Not a bad roster if you ask me. The listening experience reflects the diverse collection of artistes.  
  
Another great find!!
