Ryley Walker joins forces with Kikagaku Moyo to venture into (equally unpronounceable) Khruangbin's blissed-out Asian psyche-blues territory.

Recorded live at Le Guess Who? in Utrecht, The Netherlands, it features the two bands, Kikagaku Moyo from Tokyo and Ryley Walker's four piece jamming over two sides of vinyl.

Like many of these improvised, single take albums - you can relive it without repetition multiple times.   
That however can be a problem  - that immediacy element is missing from this record.

Time will tell.
