### Another remarkable, genre non-specific, masterwork from the mysterious UK collective that is Sault.

 After 99 days following it's release (June 2021) this record has already been pulled from streaming services completely and will never see a re-pressing.

 I'm hoping my newly minted vinyl copy doesn't self-disintegrate in the next few months.
