### Possibly XTC's most reviled album but for me it's just full of wonderful moments. This is post Andy Partridge's melt down and led to his refusal to ever tour again.

 Very solemn and restrained, it's definitely not your usual pop-infused hooks to the hilt sort of record. Personally it's one of those records I return to regularly.

 Aside from Drums and Wires, their early break through record (and in my top 20), the did their best work in the studio following this.
