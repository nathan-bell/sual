### Soul Jazz Records New York Noise: Dance Music from the New York Underground 1977-1982    
  
On several trips to London, I'd always make a point of visiting Sounds of the Universe at 7 Broadwick Street in Soho.  This is the home of “Soul Jazz Records”.  
  
This place was always brim full of the obscure and seemingly intangible, but despite this, browsing through the racks was always an adventure.    
  
I was never overly adventurous, usually feeling a bit out of my depth but made a few CD purchases here and there. If you let me loose there now, I'd emerge with a big pile of vinyl under my arm.    
  
As I've said before, I'm now more inclined to purchase a compilation on vinyl and forgo my need to re-purchase existing albums that I already have access to on CD or via a streaming service.

 This record was thrust into my arms by a very excited Mr. Smithies on my last visit to The Family Jewels.   
All I can say is "WOW!!!".  Astounding from start to finish - it's uncompromising, synapse mushing magic.
