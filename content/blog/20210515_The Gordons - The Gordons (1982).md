### This band is renowned for being the loudest band that ever existed. 

 While my stereo can't do it justice, extreme volume would let these seven humongous tracks breath/bleed accordingly.

 Everett True in Melody Maker reported that "When they played at the same size venue as Motorhead they required four extra PA sound systems.

 Saying The Gordons were LOUD is like saying The Beatles were a POP GROUP - not so much detonating as devastating".

 The Gordons eventually became the equally brilliant and sonically challenging [Bailter Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailter_Space).
