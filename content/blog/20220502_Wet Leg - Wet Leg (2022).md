### This record has been well (over)hyped for the last 6 months or so. But you know what, in my book it lives up to every accolade that's been thrown at it.

 On the back of releasing the fabulous single "Chaise Longue", Isle Of Wight locals, Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers, have really struck gold.

 Ridiculously hooky and witty, Wet Leg is already up there with my favourite releases of the year.
