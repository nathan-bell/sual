### Bob Stanley and Jason Wood present new adventures in European music 1972-1980

 Another fantastic ACE compilation this time focusing on an imaginary soundtrack to Bowie and Iggy's Berlin hangout, Cafe Exil, in the mid-70s.

 At times it's stark and somewhat bleak with the synthetic sounds of the time oozing out like a tube of sticky dark paste. When things are warm and bubbly, reality seems even further removed.

 A fabulous snapshot of the time.
