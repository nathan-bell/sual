### This reminds me of the minimalist approach that [Melbourne's Jonnine Standish takes with her duo HTRK](http://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2021/8/26/htrk-venus-in-leo-2019). While there's more experimentation on that wonderful record, the less-is-more ethic taken on this record is similar. http://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2021/8/26/htrk-venus-in-leo-2019

 Recommended by Uncut's "what's on the playlist", now streaming via Tidal.

 Eve Adams hails from Oklahoma but now resides in LA. She travelled there on a big metal bird.
