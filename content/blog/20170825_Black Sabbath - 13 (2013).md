### I picked up this 2x vinyl/2 CD package for an absolute pittance a few months ago at TWH. I had been stalking it for a while and took my opportunity when they had one of their ridiculous sales. 

 While I've listened to it fleetingly, this is my first proper listen all the way through.

 I must declare Toni Iommi and Ozzy are in top form and it's a surprisingly competent and rewarding listen. One can't expect the riff-age and carnage of their first albums but it's pretty close to being a return to form.  
   
Unexpectedly good!
