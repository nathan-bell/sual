### My top NZ Desert Island disc. Definitely my most played NZ record of all time and finally purchased on vinyl.

 It's big, it's bold, it's brilliant! 

 I'm also wading through Shayne Carter's autobiography "Dead People I have Known". 

 He's a great story teller and the not-quite-linear writing style works brilliantly. Highly recommended.

 Back to the record. An album I never ever tire of.
