### I didn't hesitate one second in picking up this fabulous food-fixated first-in-class classic record at Palmerston North's JB-Hifi during my recent travels.

 I wouldn't know where to start in trying to explain the magic of Cibo Matto, so I'm not going to. 

 Jason Ankeny from Allmusic.com summarises the difficulty here "A Japanese-born duo relocated to New York and christened with an Italian band name, Cibo Matto's music mirrored the melting-pot aesthetics of their origins, resulting in a heady brew of funk samples, hip-hop rhythms, tape loops, and fractured pop melodies all topped off by surreal narratives sung in a combination of French and broken English". 

 The vinyl, courtesy of Music On Vinyl, sounds fantastic.
