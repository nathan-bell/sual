### It's hard to believe that the Doves first record, the wonderful "Lost Souls" with that astounding lead-in track "Firesuite", was made in 2000.

 This, their second record, continues that brilliance seamlessly. 

 I got a bit excited at the red shed yesterday when I saw a 5CD box set of "Doves" albums for $4.95. I didnâ€™t end up buying it cos I was sure I had all of their albums.  
  
I've always been a completist - and today I've just realised that I don't have the "Lost Sides" CD in my collection.

 It's back on the bike then!
