### I've got 30 minutes to spare this afternoon. I've therefore taken a speed over substance approach.

 This classic (highly regarded by speed metal purests anyway) is literally all over in a flash - but what a flash!Â 

 Every metal cliche ever created is realised on this mid-80's release. It's entertaining and as far removed from serious as possible.
