### Don't you dear judge me for listening to this! I grew hair on my bollocks listening to this record.   
  
Who doesn't love Joe Walsh's slide guitar on "Victim Of Love"? and his writing and vocal contribution on "Pretty Maids.."  It was really his guitar playing that I'd been listening too on James Gang and Joe Walsh records prior to this behemoth. It certainly wasn't the saccharine-sweet strings on this.    
  
It was also because of this record that punk was necessary!    
  
For me, this may very well have been one of Adult Oriented Rock's last gasps.
