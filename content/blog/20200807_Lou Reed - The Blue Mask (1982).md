 Aside from the brilliant and incomparable Lou Reed/David Bowie/Mick Ronson recording that is "Transformer" this is my favourite Lou Reed album. By a long shot!    
  
Aside from The Velvets, this is by far the best band Lou Reed ever worked with.   
  
With the absolutely brilliant Robert Quine on guitar and an even more remarkable bass player in Fernando Saunders, this is such a rich and musical experience.
