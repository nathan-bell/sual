### I just can’t stop raving about ACE Records.   
  
The latest compilation, show casing the mid-70s, is another brilliant sampler of the music of the time. Sonically astounding, this is groovy stuff to wend away the late afternoon.   
  
There's a lot packed onto its 4 sides of vinyl. 21 tracks that include Lynsey De Paul (singing my favourite song on the album "Sugar Shuffle", Cliff Richard doing a rockin' version of "Nothing To Remind Me" and Azimuth's goes proggy with "Montreal City".   
  
Punk was just around the corner but this is a great endorsement of some brilliant music that couldn’t be further down the other end of that continuum.
