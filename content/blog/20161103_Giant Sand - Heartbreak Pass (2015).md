### Finally bought myself a copy of this. I've been listening to this on Tidal for months and just needed a copy for prosperity. I'm loving it.

 I just don't get the same satisfaction when listening to music knowing I'm not seeing, touching or possessing something - even if it is only a CD. It's weird but it definitely makes a difference to my listening experience.

 This is apparently the last Giant Sand record, Howie Gelb is soon to go solo. He's got lots of helpers on this though, notebly Jason Lytle, Steve Shelley, Grant Lee Philips and Ilse DeLange to name several.

 It makes for some fabulous collaborations and a brilliantly diverse record.
