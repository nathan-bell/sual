### Nothing prepares the listener for this. It's Arthur Russell's only non-collaborative record consisting of cello, voice (somewhere between Boz Scaggs and Nick Drake) and in-studio or live, sounds and textures. There's also lots and lots of reverb and delay.

 While there's no real song structure, it's surprisingly musical and melodic. You've just got to go digging.   
A recording of songs is clearly not the point. 

 This is experimental, avant-guarde music that will be challenging for most users and itâ€™s probably not the best place to start.   
  
This great album is just one string to his bow, his genre hopping throughout his short life was extraordinary.
