### This pre-Covid, end-of-September 2019 event could really have done with a shake up.   
  
The world has changed since this, and in musical terms, decades earlier. The musical naivety and arrogance of this barrage of bluesy woozy guitar wankery, even from the ladies, is getting a bit tiresome. Other than that, its fuckin' great!   
  
It's not all blues, there's a good mix of country, rock and traditional music. Gustavo Santoaolalla’s stunning "Lait/De Ushuaia A La Quiaca" is mesmerising and bereft of guitar slinging. It’s worth the purchase price alone.

 However, as Julian Casablancas of The Strokes proclaims ["...blues-rock is creatively exhausted".](https://www.guitarworld.com/news/the-strokes-think-blues-rock-is-creatively-exhausted-please-no-more-of-that)
