### As [previously explained](https://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2020/12/7/lord-huron-lonesome-dreams-2012), this was the compilation that was playing the track "Danger" by Pylon as a spooky coincidence when I walked into The Family Jewels on Saturday. Of course I just had to buy it.

 Keith Haring was an iconic New York artist who was very much part of the collaborative 80’s New York art and music world especially the emerging/merging punk, new wave, disco and club scene.

 Although he died in 1990 at just 31, this compilation is a mixtape that reflects Haring’s wide-ranging musical influences and connections. 

 As with all Soul Jazz compilations it's a real treasure trove of obscurities.
