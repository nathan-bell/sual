### Trying to write some kind of coherent approbation of this record is nigh on impossible. I've tried to make sense of it, I really have.

 The 2 minute, and totally silent track "The World I left Behind" actually makes the most sense. Everything else is totally off the radar.

 While I could never recommend this at all for the weary, conventional meat and 3 veg type of listener, It's a record that wrangles the senses.

 Extraordinary.
