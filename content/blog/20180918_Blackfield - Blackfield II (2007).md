### Itâ€™s Spring! I've been ruthless lately, ridding myself of all the unnecessary shit that gets in the way and starts to irritate. I won't dwell on the mundane too much but my main emphasis lately is to simplify my life.   
  
To illustrate the point, I've just rejigged my main music listening system componentry to a basic stereo setup - just amp and player. I've got rid of extra speakers, a multi-channel receiver, lots of cabling and connects and a whole heap of pain points. And I tell you what, it sounds fucking fantastic!!   
  
This 2007 effort from Mr. Wilson and Aviv Geffen benefits greatly and reveals itself brilliantly. It's simple, effective and bereft of rocket science. My future in a nutshell.
