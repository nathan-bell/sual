### OK here it is. As well as being my favourite record it's also the most significant, full stop! Â It's a bold move I know but this just has so much past history for me, from adolescence through to (apparent) adulthood.

 It's also my go to record when I want to escape, retreat or need some primal scream therapy.

 It's fucking bonkers, and very English, but there's nothing I'd rather listen to than this.  
Steve Hackett, Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford and yes, Phil Collins were/are the bee's knees.

 The guitar solo in "Firth of Fifth" is my funeral march. Goose bump material.
