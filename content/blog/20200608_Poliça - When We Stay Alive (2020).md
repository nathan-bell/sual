### Poliça are a really difficult band\* to try and explain or categorise. (\* Poliça is really just singer/songwriter Channy Leaneagh and producer Ryan Olson from the larger and just as uncategorisable collective Gayngs). 

 This is the sixth Poliça record and was released soon after vocalist Channy Leanagh badly injured her back falling off a roof at her home in Minneapolis. This was her recuperation record.   
  
Lyrically and musically it's a bit more emotional and cathartic than previous records but doesn't suffer in the least.   
  
There are certain bands that I'm not keen on sharing - a secret pleasure perhaps or it might be just the fact that others simply wouldn't "get it". This is one of those bands I treasure that I'm dead keen on keeping to my self.
