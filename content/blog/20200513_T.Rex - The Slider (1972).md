### This is another one of my big influential records I listened to as a bored, shy and self-absorbed 12 year old at my uncle’s house in Palmerston North.   
  
It’s clear that Bowie learnt some of his moves and chops listening to and watching Marc Bolan. Mr. Ronson probably pinched a few licks from his particularly tasty guitar work on this and the preceding “Electric Warrior” record as well.    
  
Brim full of excellence, this treasure just oozes ear candy and of-it’s time musical genius.
