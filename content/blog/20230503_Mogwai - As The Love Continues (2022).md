### I've held back long enough. This is the moment to finally release the Glaswegian beast. 

 This has been tucked away, unplayed, to allay my expectant disappointment. Surely peak Mogwai is well past?.

 While there's nary a dud in the Mogwai catalogue, this relentless monster destroys any doubt that Mogwai has gone soft.

 Just another stupefyingly solid soundtrack then.
