### I picked up this original 1968 pressing recently as I was aware of it's apparent legacy as a stone cold Psychedelic classic.

 While it's hard to imagine anything more psych than this, it's not always an easy listen. 

 While mostly great, and very trippy, there's some harsh, avant guarde, discordant experimentation which simply grates.

 Don't get me wrong, it's a fabulous experience but not something you'd roll out with much regularity.
