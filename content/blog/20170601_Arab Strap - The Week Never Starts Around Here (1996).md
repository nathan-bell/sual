### Brilliantly murky and minimal, this is the wonderfully named Scottish duo's first record.

 The largely spoken vocals (with the broadest Scottish accent you've ever heard) and slightly out of sync and meandering instrumentation reminds me of Slint or The For Carnation.

 It's abrasive and incoherent in places but that just adds a few interesting strokes to a very interesting palate.

 I've possibly underappreciated this and now realise what a treat it is. I'm looking forward to revisiting Arab Strap's later albums - this was a real surprise!

 Great track: Phone Me Tonight
