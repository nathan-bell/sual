### Love em or loath em, Genesis after Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett left, became even bigger stadium fillers and fully transformed into mega selling, production line pop superstars. 

 Gabriel also became a massive musical phenom but ventured further into rock’s rich vein albeit at times favouring the untapped and unconventional.

 This 2005 DVD focuses exclusively on the post-Gabriel era aside from 1 re-recorded track, and absolute highlight for me, 1974’s “Carpet Crawlers”

 There’s no getting away from it, in their later years Genesis wrote some fucking great pop songs.

 Not essential but certainly adding greatly to music’s fabric.
