### On vinyl of course!

 Another essential record from my formative teenage years. First experienced, along with many other auditory pleasures, at my Uncle's pad in Palmerston North.

 While this is post Ronson/Spiders, and musically going in a completely different direction from what preceeded, it remains an important relic of Bowie's most amazing decade.Â 

 This LP came as part of ["Who Can I Be Now \[1974-1976\]"](http://www.davidbowie.com/news/who-can-i-be-now-1974-1976-details-55996) all vinyl box set, the second in the series. It's a beautiful thing!!
