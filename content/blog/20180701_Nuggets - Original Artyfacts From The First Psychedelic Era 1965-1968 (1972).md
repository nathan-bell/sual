### A brilliant relic of 60’s rock and possibly one of the most famous compilations of all time. Great to have this on vinyl. However it has remained un-played since I acquired it at HMV’s Oxford Street store back in October 2016. It truly is a treasure trove of great American songs giving the Poms the middle finger salute.

 I just love The Amboy Dukes version of “Baby Please Don’t Go”. Ted Nugent in stunning form. Do yourself a favour!

 It’s compilation month and I’m expecting the unexpected.
