### An end-of-century pre-millennial masterpiece.   
  
Letitia Sadier and Mary Hanson are on their best collaborative form, harmonising/counter-harmonising beautifully. The horns introduced in Dots and Loops are more prevalent throughout on this record and there's a few avant guarde moments in the mix as well.    
  
10 albums in and there's no sign of any dip in my enjoyment.
