 I can't remember if I biked over or caught the bus to my destination of Napier 15 miles away, but I do remember being there for the Saturday afternoon screening of "The Song Remains The Same" in '76 or '77.  
  
While I didn't "get" the fantasy sequences, and they are no more revealing today, there is no better live footage of Led Zeppelin in their prime.  
  
Robert Plant's trouser snake is definitely the star of the show but Jimmy Page and John Bonham are just astounding.  
  
There's a beautiful moment during the song "Since I've Been Loving You" showing two audience members in a state of joyous bliss and fully mesmerised by Jimmy Page's guitar histrionics. I would have felt exactly like they looked throughout.  
  
At the time, this was the best thing I had ever seen.
