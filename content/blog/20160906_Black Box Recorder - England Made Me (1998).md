### London, here we come. On the big 24+ hour flight tomorrow - first stop to Dubai then another 8 hour haul to Heathrow.

 Just to get in the mood I needed some very English commentary. Luke Haine's Black Box Recorder will do nicely - while not in the same vein as Genesis or Suede, it's classic, cynical and sarcastic.

 It's also a beautifully produced, rich but minimalist recording. Lovely with a pint of English ale. Â
