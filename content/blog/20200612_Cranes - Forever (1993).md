### One of the finds of my recent trip to Wellington was this amazing record. Very tastefully remastered, individually numbered and pressed on gold and black vinyl, it is physically, visually and sonically a thing of great beauty.    
  
While I would buy it just for the track “Far Away” (those fucking goose bumps again!) the entire album sounds enormous    
  
While my description could never do it any real justice there’s a real dichotomy of styles. Take the best bits from The Cure’s trilogy of late 70s albums, sprinkle some of The Sunday’s/Altered Images delicate and Faeriesque vocals and dial up the goth dirgometer to 12.
