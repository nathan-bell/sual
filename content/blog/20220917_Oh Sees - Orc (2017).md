### The genius of John Dywer never lets up throughout an array of different band monikers, (including Orinoka Crash Suite, OCS, Orange County Sound, The Ohsees, The Oh Sees, Thee Oh Sees, and Oh Sees), and a myriad of fluid genres over the last 25 years.

 While the songwriting on everything I've heard is consistently great, his guitar playing alone is enough to cement an emerging unbridled obsession. 

 This is record 20(ish).
