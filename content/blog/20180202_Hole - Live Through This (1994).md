### I should have played Rory this evening. "Too Much Alcohol" perhaps?  
  
OK it's Friday post-work - we have two choices. Go home and do some housework or have a friendly pint at The Free House.Â It's a no brainer isn't it? We stayed at home and did some chores. Yeah right!

 Any hows, a beer, several glasses of bubbly (we are elsewhere by now and with pizza), a glass of Sauvignon blanc and a Drambuie eliminates any ambition of domestic depuration.  
  
Listening to Courtney Love's explosive vociferation is a great way of seeing in the sacred weekend. Hanging off the end of a vacuum cleaner can wait another day.
