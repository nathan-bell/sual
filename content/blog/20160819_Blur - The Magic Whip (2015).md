### On Double Vinyl!

 I've had this a while, but was reluctant to play so as not to be disappointed. No fear of that however, it's a bit of a humdinger.

 While it's more reminiscient of Damon Albarn's solo output it still feels very much like a Blur record. 

 I'm not sure what prompted Blur to reform for this record as Damon Albarn was one of the busiest musicians on the planet and had great success with his other interests. 

 It's a refreshing and classy comeback.
