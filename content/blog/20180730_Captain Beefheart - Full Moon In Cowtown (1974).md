 Double vinyl recording of a live radio broadcast from Kansas City circa 1974.  
  
I was not feeling overly adventurous when I randomised this evening’s selection and grabbed this safely stashed away 2LP set. (I’m not sure when I ever thought it would be the right time to play this!?)  
  
I needn’t have worried - it’s actually a crackingly good, and thoroughly engaging set of stonking old school blues songs.  
  
There’s exceptional musicianship throughout and some especially tasty guitar playing from Fuzzy Fuscaldo and Dean Smith. The captain is also in stunning form.
