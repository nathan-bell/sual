### Fuck Yes!! While there's some poppy, happy-clappy stuff on this record (incidently, this is the brand new, freshly minted 3CD deluxe edition), there's still a wonderful, post-"Disintegration", doom-laden dirge as thick as treacle.

 I saw them tour this album at Wellington Town Hall with possibly their best ever line up. On record, they would never reach these highs again.

 While still highly respected, they are now the best Cure cover band on the planet.
