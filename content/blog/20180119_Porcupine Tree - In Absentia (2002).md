### One of my go to records when you just want to get smacked around the head (sonically speaking) without any serious investment or effort. Honestly, I can't always be bothered trying to "qualify" what I'm listening to. This record just does it's business and does it oh so very well.  
  
Possibly my favourite PT album, and certainly the first one where I thought "who the shitting hell are these dudes?".   
  
OK, like most people you don't have a clue who this Steven Wilson character is. In my mind, he's the most important musician in my musical world since Bowie.  
  
4 minutes in to "Gravity Eyelids" and I'm completely fucked! Gone, in absentia!
