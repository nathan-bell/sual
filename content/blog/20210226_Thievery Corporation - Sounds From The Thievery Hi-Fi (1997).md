### This is the perfect Friday night leave-your-brain-behind music fodder. It's 22 years plus, and around the time of this record, since I gathered at The Gathering at Kanaan Downs in Golden Bay.

 I was helping a friend out selling curries to the punters, but enjoyed the odd moments when I ventured out amongst the special people. 

 The Thievery Corporation reminds me of the mantra-inducing, spiritual stupefaction of rhythm and bass that flowed amongst the masses. It was a beautiful thing.

 I started wearing caftans, chewing on hemp and grew a big knotted plat in my hair. These were heady days.
