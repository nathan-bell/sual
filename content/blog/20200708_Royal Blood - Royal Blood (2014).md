 It’s hard to believe that this duo from Old Blighty’s Briton can make such a god forsaken racket.   
Playing just drums and bass, they could cause all sorts of inferiority complexes for many a larger ensemble.   
  
Dirtier, grungier and more economical (the songs are short and sweet) than their other swamp blues-based duo-contemporaries such as The White Stripes and The Black Keys, this album is all over in just 32 mins.   
  
This mid-afternoon transfusion of Royal Blood is just the ticket to kick out those winter blues.
