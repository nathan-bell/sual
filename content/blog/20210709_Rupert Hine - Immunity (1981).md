### One real blessing of spending an extra week in Melbourne, following a 7 day Covid-19 Aussie/NZ travel bubble pause, was spending some quality time trawling the records shops in Melbourne City and Brunswick/Smiths Street in Collingwood.

 I managed to smuggle 17 LPs across the Tasman courtesy of my mule, and current wife, Sarah. (If that's not the measure of a rich and lasting relationship then I don't know what is!)

 Anyhow, this particular record was the icing on the cake and picked up secondhand in VG++ quality. 

 "Immunity", a very apt name given the current state of the world, still sounds ahead of it's time today despite some clear 80's production values.
