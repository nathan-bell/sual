### I happened to be viewing some YouTube video footage of Whakaari (White Island) just prior to, during and after the 2019 eruption, while listening to this record. It proved to be a powerful and mesmerising soundtrack to such a catastrophic event.   
  
This is grinding, psychedelic garage rock at it's finest without any verse getting in the way. Wall-to-wall chorus.   
  
Not for the faint hearted.
