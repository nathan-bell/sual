### It’s a bit scary putting this record on when people are around. I was happy when my wife Sarah left the house this evening midway during the first track. While mostly accepting of my eclectic tastes, I have no way of protecting her from this. 

 I can be a bit self conscious about music sometimes.  
  
It’s much the same with film choices. If I happen to put on a “challenging” movie (or crap for that matter), it’s as though I produced, directed and starred in it. I’m held personally accountable.

 Kid A is a fabulous record that I would never be brave enough to inflict on others. It’s a record you need to discover for yourself. I cannot be held accountable.
