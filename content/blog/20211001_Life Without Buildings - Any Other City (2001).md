### A fabulous, lady-led band from the century's turn who sound like they shared a dressing room with the Slits and The Fall. 

 The songs are not so much sung as yelled by the incendiary Sue Tomkins but it's all the better for it. The band is exceptional as well. 

 Repetition. Repetition. Repetition is also the mantra. Just brilliant!
