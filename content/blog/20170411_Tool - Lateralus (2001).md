### **Live: Friday 19th April 2002 - Queen's Wharf Event Centre, Wellington (support Melvins)Live: Friday 21st January 2011 - The Big Day Out, Auckland**

 Two unforgettable gigs nearly 10 years apart. The first show, brilliantly supported by Melvins, was in a relatively intimate venue in Wellington compared to their big arena show in Auckland 9 years later.

 With only four albums to show for in nearly 2 decades they certainly make up for their low yield with a stunning live experience.

 In Wellington, support Melvins were astounding despite playing only 2 super long "songs". They were worthy of the price of admission alone. Afterwards, Tool just hit the pummel button and delivered a jaw dropping set along with a stunning video show, banter less catatonic stage antics and live naked wall climbers. (You really had to be there!) 

 Their BDO show was a similarly mesmerising encounter but being post Ramstein and Primal Scream they just didn't quite win the day for me. Actually, it was Die Antwoord in the Boiler Room earlier in the day that left me stunned. Still the best all round Big Day Out ever!
