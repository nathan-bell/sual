### When I hear Daniel Ash play his guitar, it always reminds me of Mick Ronson without The Thin White Duke chewing on his guitar strings. This is circa "The Man Who Sold The World" through to "Ziggy".  
  
Just listen to "Sweet Lover Hangover". The tone and squall of his Gibson is truly evocative of the great one.  
  
Actually, the very first Bauhaus record I ever heard, Daniel Ash's original band with fellow Love And Rocket members David J and Kevin Haskins, minus Pete Murphy, was a wonderful cover of ["Ziggy Stardust"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjjXJ27JfcI).

 Some critics had a field day with Sweet FA. The Love And Rockets boys have lost their way they said. They can go and fuck themselves. Mick definitely would have approved.
