### I was thrilled to get a copy of this very limited Record Store Day release on 10" clear vinyl.

 It took Alan Vega and Martin Rev, the core of Suicide, more than 30 years to get the recognition they deserved. 

 Their story is worth hearing if you want to appreciate their true influence on a zillion punk and new/no wavers.

 If you can get over the incessant laughter of one of the co-hosts have a listen to the wonderful two part podcast ["No Dogs In Space"](https://open.spotify.com/episode/27a5KNBqhraNg5dwvKB6GJ)
