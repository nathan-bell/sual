### I always wanted to listen to this record this evening.   
  
It's not quite reverse chronologically but fuck it! I make up and change the rules as I go. I'll still be on track but just taking a few liberties along the way.   
  
This is one of the many remastered special editions that just oozes class and superior sonics. Sounding absolutely fantastic, [it looks even better](https://duophonic.ochre.store/release/142767-stereolab-sound-dust-expanded-edition).   
  
Faultless and entirely captivating, these vinyl editions leave the old CD versions sounding like a transistor radio.
