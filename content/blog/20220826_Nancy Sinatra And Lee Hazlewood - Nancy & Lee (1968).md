### I really hummed and ha'd about "needing" to have this on vinyl. After all, I've already invested in the magnificent [Nancy Sinatra 2 LP compilation "Start Walking"](http://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2022/3/20/nancy-sinatra-start-walkin-1965-1976-2021)which spans the years 1965 to 1976.

 The gold for me has always really been her duos with Lee Hazlewood. The aforementioned record contains 9 wonderful duets. 

 I'm really glad I didn't, this 24 bit, Hi-Res FLAC version sounds fantastic. No mortgage needed afterall.

 While you can never have enough Nancy, whatever the format, I have more than enough ways of listening to it thanks very much. Digital continues to fight back!
