### I needed some chill down music this evening. I've just arrived back from Auckland after a spectacular live show last night at one of the best venues I've ever been to. In all of my pre-gig anticipation/expectation it couldn't have been any better.

 After such an brilliant event it's just best to live in another dimension for a while. The Horrors fit that bill nicely. 

 The Horrors "Skying" was one of my favourite "anti-rock" releases in the last 10 years so I jumped at the chance of picking up this beautifully packaged 1xDVD/2xCD/4x12" box set in the sale bin at Marbecks.

 While I don't usually go for re-interpretations/remixes, this is just brilliant as a stand-alone album in it's own right. I just love Connan Mockasin's remix of "Still Life"

 I took a punt, and it's wall to wall bliss (aside from one or two turkeys) and not the horror show I was sort of expecting.
