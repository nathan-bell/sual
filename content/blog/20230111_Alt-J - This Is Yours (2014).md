### I don't know why I even bother reading reviews on "Pitchfork.com". 

 Despite being around for more than a decade, Alt-J is a very recent discovery.  After listening to this highly regarded record, and objectively consider it to be one of the more exceptional and engaging listens I've encountered, I read one of the worst reviews ever.

 Despite widespread praise for all of their records, Pitchfork really has it in for this British three peice. It really makes you wonder what their agenda is or if they are just bitter old men with worsening hearing difficulties and journalistic Dunningâ€“Kruger issues.
