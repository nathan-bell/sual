### It was 10 years ago when Robert Plant and Alison Krauss treated the world to a brilliant collection of songs where their rock and bluegrass worlds intertwined. That was also the first time I listened to any post Zeppelin Robert Plant.

 It was a fabulous record that takes pride of place in my vinyl collection.

 As with that album, this record is all about restraint. There's a few up tempo songs, but it seems he's never in a hurry to blow the barn door down with that magnificent voice. I'm quite sure he still could though!

 A beautiful, countrified blues soundtrack, it's another mesmerising listen.
