### Black Friday sales bring out the worst in me. I took advantage of sales at JB Hi-fi and Flying Out and bought a few CD box sets I've had my eye on. 

 The biggest surprise of this whole crazy Black Friday palava however, was 50% off a range of new releases at The Family Jewels. 

 The only thing better than getting shiny new crack, is getting shiny new, half price crack. 

 Apparently, this absolute gem was part of a still-in-the-shrink OST haul that Mr. Smithies had recently traded.

 Beautifully packaged in a thick, gatefold sleeve on ectoplasm splatter vinyl, this Mono release sounds as good as it looks. 

 It's a swinging, funky, crazy record. It's got Phillis Diller singing on it FFS!.
