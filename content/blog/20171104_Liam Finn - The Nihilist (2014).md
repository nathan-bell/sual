### Had a big trawl of the bargain bins yesterday (unusual I know!) and picked up quite a few goodies for bugger all. Gary Clark. Jr, Peter Hook (et al), John Cooper Clarke, Caravan, Passenger, Blancmange and this gem from Mr. Finn Jr.

 Starting off rather conventionally, it takes a 90 degree turn at about track 4 when it flips the overdrive button and drops a few wheelies. 

 This record was a big surprise.
