### It's no surprise to me at all that I queued up like many others to get my copy of Lorde's new record.  This is a big, grown up record that oozes classy production and great songs to match.  
For one so young - she's also a lyrical, story telling genius.

 Having listened to this several times since it's release on Friday 16th June, I'm quick to do it all over again.  
  
This and Aldous Harding's recent gem, are my two favourite records of the moment.
