### Third time lucky. I tried to listen to a couple of CDs from "The Redcross Collection" this evening. 

 That was a painful 6 minutes of my life that I'll never get back - they were truly hideous.

 Now this is more like it. While not quite up there with Nancy and Lee, or Serge and Jane, there is a certain charm and chemistry going on between Adam & Binki.

 While lacking a bit of humour, these 10 quirkly little duets are a great throw back to 60's twee pop.
