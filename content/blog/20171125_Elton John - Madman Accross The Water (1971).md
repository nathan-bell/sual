### One of my watershed albums.

 As a new college entrant I was now getting exposed to proper, grown up music. Despite this, I still slept and ate everything Reg and Bernie produced.

 This and what followed for the next 4 or 5 years was astounding. "Honky Chateau", "Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player", "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road", "Caribou" "Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy" and "Rock Of The Westies".  

 Whatever the subjective merits of this man's music is in comparison to others, to me, it was Elton's music that started it all.  

 Hearing this today on beautiful, newly minted vinyl, it is still a real treat.
