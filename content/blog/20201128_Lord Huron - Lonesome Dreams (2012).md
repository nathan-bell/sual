### This pre-loved record has obviously been played to death and there's a few pops and crackles in evidence. However, it wasn't until I saw the debris on my stylus that I realised that I needed to do some immediate needle maintenance.

 The veil was lifted and the beauty of this new discovery was suddenly revealed. This is the first of two records purchased from Smithies on a whim - just coz I just liked the covers. Two (of many) impulsive decisions gone right!.

 Talk about synchronicity! 

 My latest musical obsession is a pretty obscure band called Pylon from Athens, Georgia. Literally no one has heard of them. This morning "Sound Opinions" a regular music nerd podcast I listen to did a feature on Pylon. I listened to it mid-afternoon.

 Later in the afternoon I went for a beer at The Free House and briefly poked my head in to say hi to Smithies. Playing on side one of a compilation "Keith Haring - Influences and Connections" released a year or two ago, is Pylon’s “Danger”.

 Coincidence or is there something a bit more spooky at play???
