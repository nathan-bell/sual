### I must admit, I was expecting a bit more of a sideways move from Mr. Berry. (He of "Frost Of London", "The Mighty Boosch" and the US version of "What We Do In The Shadows").   
  
There's no doubt that he's a very talented man and way up there as one of my top funny men/absurdists, but as a musician this just feels a bit bereft of freshness or diversity.   
  
It's enjoyable and it's clever but it's not that memorable. Definitely not vinyl worthy I'm afraid.  However, having said all that - this just might be a grower?
