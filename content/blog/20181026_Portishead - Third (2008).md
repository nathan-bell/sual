### I have only listened to this record 3 or 4 times. It is a truly unsettling experience and I do mean this is the most positive way. 

 It's an absolute mess of a record and what is most surprising is that works at all. There's a genuine musical/performance twist around every corner and it's brilliance is that you relive this every time you listen to it.

 While it's not as abrasive and truly pioneering as Cabaret Voltaire, it has a similar sense of uniqueness. It couldn't be any further removed from their previous "mainstream" release "Dummy". 

 I've realised tonight what a fucking amazing record it is! Most definitely vinyl worthy. It's now on my list.
