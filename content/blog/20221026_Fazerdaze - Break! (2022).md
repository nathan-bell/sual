### I tried; I really did. I had a few things to listen to this afternoon, nothing I physically owned thank goodness, but I quickly became underwhelmed and even irritated with stuff passing as entertainment. Any high expectations and anticipation were short lived.

 I’m really over big bloated arty farty pretense. Just give me simple.

 Now this little 5 track ep from one of NZ’s own really hits the sweet spot.

 I loved her first album recorded 5 years ago so was thrilled to hear this. Fabulous
