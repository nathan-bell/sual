### I knew absolutely nothing about this band other than they were completely underappreciated and are now worthy of re-evaluation. Well that's what the hype sticker on the cover says.

 I picked this up in Wellington (or Lower Hutt?) during a 20% off vinyl grab last year thinking I'd take a punt (as I often do). 

 On my very first listen this evening, this is great  - prickly, abrasive and unhinged. A combo of many great bands of the time. The Fall, Wire, The Gang Of Four immediately come to mind.

 There's a new (non)rockumentary about them that came out in 2020 called "King Rocker".
