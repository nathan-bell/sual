### Throw a bit of Lizzy, Skynyrd and some James Brown in the mix and this is what you get. It's a crazy m√©lange but these Texans really make it work.  
  
I was a bit disappointed at first after listening to the first couple of tracks - it just sounded a bit conventional, but it truly redeems itself as it progresses.

 Another cheapy from TWH. Aren't I just so clever! (ad nauseum)
