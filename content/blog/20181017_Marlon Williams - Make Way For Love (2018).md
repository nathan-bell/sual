### A talent like this doesn't come along very often - ahem, unless you come from the lower South Island. 

 Nadia Reid, Aldous Hardling and Marlon Williams are part of the mother folking good South Island Kiwi's pushing their esoteric but trending trendy, angst-ridden tunes around the globe.

 This record, on shiny new red vinyl, was picked up as a $20 mislabelled item from the red shed a few months ago. I've been waiting for the moment. Tonight is that moment and it quickly reveals itself as a thing of exceptional beauty.

 One of the years top releases without a doubt.
