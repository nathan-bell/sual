### This is the first CD from my recent Richmond Red Cross haul and all I can say is it's off to a great start.

 Classically trained Dominick Martin, aka Calibre, is usually associated with Drum and Bass, but goes solo on this more "song" oriented record.

 While it's still clearly got a toe or two dipped in the DNB pool, it has a wonderful ebb and flow to it. It reminds me of some of Brian Eno's earlier work.

 Very nice.
