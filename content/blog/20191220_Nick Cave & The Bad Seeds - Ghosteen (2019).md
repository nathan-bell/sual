 Holy Mother this is intense!   
  
While on the far left side of the heavy spectrum musically, it’s but a whisper, it still jolts you to the core. You know his sentiment is real. At times it feels like a personal counselling session with Mr. Cave.   
  
I've had my own loss(es) this year and this hits many a raw nerve. It’s a totally cathartic experience and one I don’t mind repeating.  
  
The thing that makes this work so well is the electronic noodling courtesy of Warren Ellis.  Probably the most important release of the year for me.
