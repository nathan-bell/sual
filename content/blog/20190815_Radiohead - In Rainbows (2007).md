### Absolute awesomeness from the worlds best band from Oxford. Recently purchased on vinyl to add to my "must-have-on-vinyl" list.

 There's a few "must-haves" from the R-Heads. "OK Computer", "Kid A" and possibly "The Bends" - which I must add to the collection.

 On vinyl, their music breathes into infinity. This uncompressed, lossless music fills up every space. There's not a lot of knob fiddling on this one, just great compositions.
