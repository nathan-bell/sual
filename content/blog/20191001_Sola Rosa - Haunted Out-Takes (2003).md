### This freebie grab bag from one of our Shut Up And Listen sessions, is hitting all of the right notes.

 Reminding me a lot of Zero 7 and St. Germain, Andrew Spraggon is one very talented multi-instrumentalist and producer.

 Top shelf Kiwi electronica. I'm packing this in the car for a long vehicular sojourn.
