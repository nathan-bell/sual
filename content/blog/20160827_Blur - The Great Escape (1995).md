### Still working sequentially through Blur's massive 21 box.  
This is their forth record in as many years and follows on from the brilliant Parklife.  
I've played a bit of Mr. Albarn this month but I'm by no means sick of hearing his voice and inventiveness.  
I might throw on some Gorillaz later for good measure.
