### One of the greatest finds of this year is this killer record from San Fran's totally unhinged Thee Oh Sees.

 Impossible to categorise, to me they fit somewhere between King Gizard and the Wizard Lizard and The Bevis Frond. 

 There, that's made it easy for everyone.

 Anyhow, this is a absolute stonker of a record that I will play to death.
