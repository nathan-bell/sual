### This relic from the very late 70's is as infectious as Covid-19!    
  
At just under 40 minutes, there's not one wasted note.  Guitarist Ricky Wilson (who tragically died in 1985) did more riffage on this album, and with only 4 strings FFS!, than many guitarists would achieve in a lifetime.   
  
It's party time in The Grove.
