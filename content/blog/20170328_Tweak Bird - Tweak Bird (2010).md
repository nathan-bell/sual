### Dirty old psychedelic blues played by Illinoisan brothers Caleb and Ashton Bird. (They call it sludge metal in those parts!) Riff after infectious riff - it's relentlessness is wall to wall.Â 

 But wait - it's also full of crazy little musical twists and turns. It contains sax and flute for god sake! Touring extensively with The Melvins has certainly painted their grimy little world brightly.

 Loving it!

 Best track(s): A Sun/Ahh Ahh, Distant Highways
