### With the recent demise of [Neil Innes](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/neil-innes-died-monty-python-star-has-dead-age-75-cause-of-death-natural-causes-2019-12-30/) , just prior to the turn of the new decade, the world lost a true comedic and musical genius.  
  
An honourary Python member, he was also leader of The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and the lead Rutle.   
  
While the Rutles films and records were clearly satirical and a parody of the worlds greatest band, the music stands alone as something really special.  
  
RIP Mr Innes.
