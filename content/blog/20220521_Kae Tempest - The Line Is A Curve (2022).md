### Usually I'm not overly bothered with a poet or spoken word artist and wouldn't necessarily cross the street to involve myself. 

 However, there are a handful of spoken word artists, usually ackompanied with a band or doing their own instrumentation, that I do make an effort with. And there are one or two that just can't sing to save themselves.

 This list includes Mark E Smith (The Fall), Mike Skinner (The Streets), Henry Rollins, Dr. John Cooper Clark, Anne Clark and Laurie Anderson. Now you can add London-born Kate/Kae Tempest to that select bunch.

 Now, what's really clever about this new release is the fabulous collaboration with other musicians to manufacture a truly superb mix of rap and electronica.

 One of the year's best.
