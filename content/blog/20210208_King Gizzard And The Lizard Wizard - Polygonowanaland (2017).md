### The Aussies seem to have the Psychedelic-Progressive-Space-Metal market completely cornered.

 Sounding in places like a very early Yes record, especially on the first 10 minute opener, it quickly morphs into a wonderful collage of hypnotic fuzzy bliss.

 This beautifully packaged record on aqua blue vinyl sounds as good as it looks.
