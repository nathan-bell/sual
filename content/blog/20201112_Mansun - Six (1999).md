### This record never ceases to reveal something new each and every time I take pleasure in listening to it.

 (Now that's a bit spooky, I googled a review of the record and found the following echoing my thoughts. "‘Six’ still fascinates and intrigues my senses 21 years on, while my ears still manage to find new things to focus on every time I hear the LP".)

 I could have been a fucking music critic.   
  
Seriously though, this is the cats pajamas of intriguing records. Right up there with the very best, but highly misunderstood masterpieces.
