### Hey, I like this. Ian McCulloch and Will Sergeant go full throttle and grungy during their post-bunnymen/pre-reformation period.

 Full of searing guitars and anthemic meanderings - it's a wall to wall classic.

 Arrogance is acceptable if it lives up to the hype - Ian McCulloch has it up to his ears.
