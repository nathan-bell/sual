### This Danish band is just extraordinary. Their record, 2005's "And the Glass Handed Kites" is an epic masterpiece that demands at least a yearly, uninterrupted aural immersion.

 "Comporting Sounds", all 9 minutes of it, from 2003's "Frengers" is one of the most perfect anthems I've ever heard.

 Seemingly a band that can do no wrong, this record just continues to reinforce that.

 Not really having any motivation to play much this evening, I immediately reached for Mew. What a fabulous choice!

 BTW Kiwi Kimbra sings on the track "The Night Believer".
