### Another great release for a SW/PT newbie to wrap their ears around. This record, along with "In Absentia" and "Deadwing" would be the perfect place to start appraising Mr. Wilson's PT output.

 Like many of his previous and subsequent releases, there is often a dual-media surround sound version included. In this case there's a 5.1 DTS DVD-Audio disc along with a standard CD. 

 The CD I'm playing sounds stunning enough, the DTS version of this record takes it to another level completely. 

 While SW is possibly the world's greatest living hi-res remaster producer of other artists recordings, he delivers that same impeccable standard on his own recordings.
