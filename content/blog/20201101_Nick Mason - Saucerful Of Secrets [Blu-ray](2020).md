### I did NOT expect this! A few of those try-hard Psych bands could learn a trick or two from these dudes.

 This new take on Pink Floyd is so refreshing after endless Roger Waters and David Gilmour reduxes where the two antagonists are re-peddling the same old tired post-Meddle repertoire.

 Nick Mason, Floyd's drummer goes right back to day one, employing a roster of seasoned musicians and teleports back to pre-70's Psychedelic Floyd.

 There's a great smattering of Syd Barrett songs and many others that have never made an appearance at any gig in over 40 years.
