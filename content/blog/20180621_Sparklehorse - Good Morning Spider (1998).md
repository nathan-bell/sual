 Some times it's not fair being a bottom-shelfer! Some of my favourite albums are not always in easy reach and may at times get completely overlooked. I especially feel sorry for my X,Ys and Zs! - they're in no man's land! Bottom and End.  
  
As fair as I'm concerned, and despite being physically down yonder, Mark Linkous's magnificent Sparklehorse is most definitely top shelf.  
  
This is a beautiful and masterful example of an outsider at the top of his game. May he rest in peace.
