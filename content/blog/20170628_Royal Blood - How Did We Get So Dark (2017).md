### I just so impressed with the $2.95c treasure that was Royal Blood's first record, I stumbled across in the old Warehouse bargain bins. 

 It left me completely intoxicated with riff after riff. I did not hesitate to grab this without a second thought. This picks it up even more - if you can believe it! "She's Creeping" has some of the most stunning riffing I've ever heard. 

 Not even a grower. It hits you from the first needle drop.
