### One of my finds of the year, I knew absolutely nothing about HTRK (Hate Rock) or this record, prior to my recent travels to Melbourne.

 I had prepared and made a playlist of recommended and un-heard albums, via Tidal, for listening on the 3 hour flight. This record in particular proved to be nothing less than revelatory.

 Possibly crude in my description, but it has the combined feel of The Cure's "Seventeen Seconds", lady XX's complete catalogue and a non-gibberish Cocteau Twins all wrapped up into one.

 You know the best part though, when purchased at the wonderful [Rocksteady Records](http://rocksteadyrecords.com.au)in Melbourne CBD, it was revealed to me that they lived and recorded locally as a Melbourne-based duo.
