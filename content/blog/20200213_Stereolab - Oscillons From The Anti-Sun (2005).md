### While I've replaced ALL of my Stereolab CDs over the last 12 months with astoundingly well remastered and plump-with-music, vinyl editions, I won't be getting rid of this rare 3CD/1DVD compilation anytime soon.   
  
I lugged this over-packaged package home from one of my UK trips, but decided to discard the less than economical plastic casing prior to travel. While this brain-fade certainly lowers its resale value, it's no great loss -  itâ€™s a real keeper.
