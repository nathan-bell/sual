### This is the ultimate fairy tale album.

 Peter Perret is probably lucky to be still on the planet yet alone in absolutely top form on this recording.

 After producing three of my favourite albums between 1978 and 1980 as leader of The Only Ones, this really is a remarkable return from obscurity.

 As good as, if not better than anything he's ever done. Just FANTASTIC!!
