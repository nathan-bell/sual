### One of my favourites at the moment and on high rotation (if there's such a thing for streaming content) is this absolute gem from newcomer John Myrtle.

 Hard to find much about this newbie, but from the sound of this EP, it's like he's been around for decades. Every one of the 5 songs is pure ear candy.

 I can't wait for a complete album release.
