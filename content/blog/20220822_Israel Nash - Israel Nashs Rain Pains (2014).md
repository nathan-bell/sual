### The New Zealand-based "A Sonic Youth" podcast just keeps on dishing up truly splendid, under-the-radar, what-the-fuck-is-alternative-music-anyway, musical richness. That's four absolutely killer references in four episodes.

 This just about goes to the top of the list. I know nothing about Israel Nash except he hails from Texas.   
**Just listen to the title track "Rain Pains" and you will sense my delight. It couldnâ€™t be more apt given recent events.**
