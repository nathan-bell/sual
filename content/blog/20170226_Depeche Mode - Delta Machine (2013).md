### The first thing that hits you is the BIG production. Being on vinyl it feels impossibly expansive.   
It's a go slow from the first track and I'm checking the deck speed. When the vocals kick in I know it's ok. A slow tempo groove throughout but undoubtedly Depeche Mode. 

 Not up there with their best but better than acceptable.
