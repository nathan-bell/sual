### This arrived on sparkly new orange vinyl today.   
  
This 2020 remastered version is all the more remarkable in what it reveals in instrumentation. Behind the brilliant songs were some pretty good musicians.    
  
While “Poor Boy” is probably my favourite track on the record is there a more cathartic song than the masterpiece that is Tim Finn’s “I Hope I Never”?
