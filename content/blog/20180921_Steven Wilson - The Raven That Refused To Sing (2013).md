### This is Mr Wilson at his most progressive. It's Genesis, it's King Crimson, it's fucking Return To Forever. 

 There's a crash hot ensemble playing all around him and aside from vocals he does take more of a back seat on this performance wise. 

 It's trademark SW but he uses the strengths of the other musicians to reach heights he might not have previously reached. 

 One of the highlights of his 2016 Concert, and I must say ANY concert I've ever been to, was the title track "The Raven That Refused To Sing".
