### Please don't judge me but this early eighties gem is a lot better than anyone, including myself, ever gave it credit for.   
  
In fact it's really, really good!!

 On my bus ride home this afternoon I tuned into a new Podcast series called "Dean Delray's LET THERE BE TALK" (a great new discovery) which just happened to be an interview with Mike Score, leader of The Flock.

 It was intriguing stuff and when the original Ultravox was mentioned as a big influence, I thought I better check this out.

 All I can say is WOW!! What a fantastic record. 

 Even better was the album they recorded with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra in 2018 which Iâ€™ve also just finished listening to.
