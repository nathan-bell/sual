### I made the big mistake of popping in to see Smithies at "Family Jewels Records" at the Freehouse this afternoon. Hey, we were just going for a pint, chunky sandwich and some of Steve's famous chips.

 I had a fucking field day!!!! Aside from several big beautiful, freshly minted copies (I don't usually go for the old worn outs) of various  "must have on vinyl' records,  I picked up the biggest 'must have" of all!

 Jonathan Richmond's "The Modern Lovers" is a bona fide classic. I haven't seen this on vinyl for many a year. There it was with my name on it. I left Smithies pumping out "Astral Plane". 

 A very surreal and satisfying afternoon. I think the pint of 208/18 APA might have helped!
