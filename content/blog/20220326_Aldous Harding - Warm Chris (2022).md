### First listen to this brand new release hot off the record press. 

 What is truly remarkable is just how unique this long player sounds. Don’t try to decipher the lyrics - they are largely irrelevant sound shapes. It could be a phone book for all I care.

 Her remarkable voice morphs effortlessly into multiple personas across the entire record.   
You are left wondering “what was that?”
