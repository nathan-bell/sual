### [Today we lost another musical legend in Pete Shelley](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/06/pete-shelley-lead-singer-of-buzzcocks-dies-at-63). While The Buzzcocks werenâ€™t directly on my own personal radar his influence on British and American music is without question.

 Howard Devoto founded The Buzzcocks with Pete Shelley in 1977, but went on his own journey soon afterwards, with Magazine. 

 This record, made 25 years after the formation of The Buzzcocks, is a great collaboration where two opposing forces unite.
