### While not prolific, averaging 3 to 4 years between records, Mark Linkous is consistent in his greatness.  

 There's never a note wasted on all of his records. The only other artist I can think of who's similarly exceptional, is Jason Lytle of Grandaddy.

 Lytle does make an appearance on his last record, "Dark Soul of the Night". Unfortunately, Mark Linkous would not survive it's release.

 What an exceptional talent he was.
