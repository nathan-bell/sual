### I listened to the solo album of sibling Peter Brewis last night and just couldn't get enough. (I just had to listen to a couple of tracks multiple times to un-suspend my disbelief).  
  
This is brother David's solo effort recorded at around the same time and his efforts are equally remarkable.  While not as immediate as "The Week That Was" it's no less listen-able.  
While more "progressive" and experimental, both of these dudes know how to hook you in with great melodies and time changes.   
  
Field music, including their various side projects, are well up there as one of my greatest musical discoveries. Their football team might be shite, but the Brewis boys from Sunderland just can't stop scoring!
