### Behind the veil. One of the best props I've ever seen at any gig is the transparent/translucent cloak that Mr Wilson's band plays behind on this 2012 recorded gig and also experienced live for most of his 2016 gig in Auckland. 

 When in situ and projected with images - it's simply stunning. This recording from Mexico is a balls in the air showcase of what a fantastic bunch of musicians he now attracts. It's at the sharp end of Jazz/Progressive rock music and definitely not for the faint hearted. 

 If you are serious about astounding musicianship I would suggest you give this a spin - like a friend of mine, who is now completely addicted to anything SW, this was his starting place.

 You have been warned!
