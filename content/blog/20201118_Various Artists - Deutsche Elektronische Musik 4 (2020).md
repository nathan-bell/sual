### Soul Jazz Records Presents Experimental German Rock And Electronic Music 1971-83.

 This is volume four of the absolutely brilliant compilation series of early Krautrock. 

 Completely unhinged and multi-tangential, those Germans were well ahead of the game back in the early 70's/80s.

 Now every band wants to sound like Neu! or Can. This is the Sheisse!
