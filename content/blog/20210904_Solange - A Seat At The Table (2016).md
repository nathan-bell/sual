### I really needed a vinyl fix today. It's been a few weeks since I’ve done any digging.

 I rang the Smithies hotline (Facebook Messenger actually) and arranged to meet.

 Like the great dealer he is, he quickly thrust this record, amongst others, into my very ready mitts/midst.

 This gem from Beyoncé’s  ’Lil sister, Solange Knowles, is now filling the lounge with a big, warm syrupy sound oozing from my speakers. I am immediately fulfilled. Phew that was close.
