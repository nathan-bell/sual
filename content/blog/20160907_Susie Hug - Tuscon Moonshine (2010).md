### On a previous trip to the UK (2010) I was busy trawling through the bins at Sister Ray Records and heard this superb album playing.Â I didn't realise until quite a while afterwards it was two of the Calexico boys backing. No wonder their was a familiar vibe to it.

 This is such a great record. "Shed A Tear" is exceptional.

 I'm so looking forward to trawling those bins, possibly for vinyl this time, and coming across something just as sweet!

 See ya all soon
