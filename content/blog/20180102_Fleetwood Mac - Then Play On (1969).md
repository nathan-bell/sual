### My first foray into pre Buckingham-Nicks Fleetwood Mac and it’s a fucking mess! And that’s brilliant. Think "Tusk" a decade later?!

 There’s an obvious potpourri of talent going on and this is reflected in the range of songs and moods, sometimes at odds with each other.

 Peter Green’s guitar playing remains the highlight but there’s definitely a big change a happening. That Danny Kirwan boy’s a clever bastard though.

 Even better on vinyl.
