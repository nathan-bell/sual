### This really was the "band" that shocked me out of any lethargy following the mid-70s/early-80s punk/post-punk correction.

 This is the epitome of no-wave. Rather than jumping on the bandwagon, Richard H. Kirk (RIP 2021) and Stephen Mallinder just invented an electronic, dance, cut-up, funk genre that would by copied by everyone, ever since.
