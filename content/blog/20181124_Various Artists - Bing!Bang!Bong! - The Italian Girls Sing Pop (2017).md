### What a disjointed old month this has been. A day trip to Wellington, 2 nights in Auckland and back again to Wellington for another 3 days over the last couple of weeks has made me crave for my home roots. 

Coz I live in "The Wood", once surrounded by Tomato growing Italians, I thought I'd hit the home turf by playing this wonderful compilation of Italian ladies singing Italian pop music.

(I'm also 12% Italian so felt I have some license to do so).  It's a mixed bag, 60 tracks over 3 discs, but there's a good portion of the good, the weird and the unbearable. A good buy at less than $2
