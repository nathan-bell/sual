### Ok, when it really boils down to it, Hunky Dory is David Bowie's best record.

 It's best because it was my first, very innocent exposure to folky Dave transitioning into the rock'n'roll messiah. 

 This 2015 Hi-Res Remaster (96khz/24bit stereo) sounds absolutely stunning and I can't image it ever sounding better than this.

 The 4CD/Blu-Ray set and 100 page, hard back book and 60 page notebook, is a fantastic testiment to his music. 

 Along with the 5CD "Conversation Piece" set, and 2CD "Width Of A Circle", this box brings Bowie's early legacy up to his pre-Ziggy era.

 I can't wait for that one!
