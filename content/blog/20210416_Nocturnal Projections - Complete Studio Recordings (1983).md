### While a truly miserable record and definitely of its time, this relic of the early 80's is the antithesis of much of todays formulaic garbage. And that holds it in very high esteem.

 It definitely has it's charms. It's poorly recorded (but cleaned up immeasurably on this re-release), abrasive, clearly influenced by late 70s, early 80's post-punk and recorded here in Godzone when things were clearly pretty grim.

 Aside from that, it's brilliant.
