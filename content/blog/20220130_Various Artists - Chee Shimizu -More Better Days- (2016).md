### This is an absolutely fabulous compilation of Japanese rock, electronic and fringe dwelling music from the 1980s.

 Impossible to find the conventional way, (but I'll keep looking), this is courtesy of a subscribed lossless website.

 This collection is referenced in one of the my favourite and possibly the most practical music books I own.

 "You've Never Heard Your Favorite Song" by Matthew Doucet. 100 Deep Cuts To Make Your World Sound Better.

 It's a book I have been dipping into daily and playing a recommended song daily. These are mostly obscure, unheard of artists which truly deserve to be heard.

 The finds so far have been no less than astounding.
