I've been sorting out my home office today as 25% of the population is probably doing. (To be honest, I've been busy helping others get sorted and really forgot about myself until today).   
  
Any how, I reached for this CD as I re-rigged my stereo system to fit in a bit of new office work kit. It was mainly a test CD but the randomness of everything else at the moment probably makes it a good choice for tonight.    
  
This is an old favourite from late last century and features Thom Yorke's (he of Radiohead) baby brother. It's an incredibly soulful and tuneful record that is simply great and greatfully simple.
