### I hummed and ha'd about getting this on vinyl and relented today when it finally made an appearance at TWH.

 I'm glad I did - it's a fucking monster of a record that deserves the uncompressed, unrestrained bandwidth of analogue.Â 

 As a bonus, they also throw in the CD version in the package as well.

 The XX continue to sound uniquely like The XX. That's completely forgiveable - it's always brilliant.
