### Who wants to listen to music when the sky is literally falling and the murky, dank flood waters are lapping at your doorstep? 

 Four days of torrential rain and an unforgiving Maitai River has curtailed any motivation for active listening. Sonic pleasantness seems like a distant want at times such as this.

 However, amongst the dreariness, and during a brief moment of respite and momentary solace, out pops the wonderful track "Always Lone" heard via the Kiwi podcast "A Sonic Youth".

 I am now fully motivated and enchanted by this great Canadian band. This fabulous record was recorded during COVID times and as the title loudly proclaims, "Untourable".

 The sun shines through this record.
