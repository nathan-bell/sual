### Iâ€™m not sure how this album got on my Tidal playlist or how I first heard about it, but what a blinder of a record! 

 Just the drum sound alone makes for a rivetting listen. Add some other mighty fine muscianship great vocals and unexpected turns, and you have an unearthed classic. 

 Nary a wasted note from these Kansas city natives.

 Couldn't find a physical copy of this so purchased via Bandcamp for $12 NZ
