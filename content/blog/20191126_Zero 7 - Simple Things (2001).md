### I've been looking out for a vinyl version of this treasure for a while now. I happened to find it in Hamilton and this is probably the antithesis of that dump.

 OK it's wall-to-wall syrup done by a couple of Air's "Moon Safari" plagiarisers but you know what, I don't give a flying fuck - it sounds brilliant and it's VERY wife friendly.

 Of course, those tossers from [Pitchfork.com](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8940-simple-things/) certainly push the prongs in deep. They need to get a life and smell the posers.
