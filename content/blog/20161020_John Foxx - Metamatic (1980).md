### In 1977, as a bare assed teenager - Ultravox changed my life. This was the great John Foxx years and those first three records changed my musical roadmap.

 Fuck all the guitar swinging posers and big haired singers, this was real. The antithesis of punk, this batch of knob twidlers were my new heroes.

 John Foxx is still a hero of mine and I still buy his records. This record is the first in a collection of his first 4 solo records after leaving Ultravox. Â While still secretly liking the first few Ultravox records post John Foxx things definitely took a sideways turn when he left.
