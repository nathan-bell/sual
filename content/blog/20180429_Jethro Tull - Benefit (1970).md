### [5.1 DTS SW Remaster]

 What a revelation this wonderful recording is.  
  
While my Tull experience really started with "Aqualung" and "Living In The Past" and ended with 1978's "Heavy Horses", their back catalogue is well worth exploring.  
  
This record which preceded Aqualung, clearly hints at the superb songwriting and musicianship that followed. It's a melange of folk and rock where acoustic meets electric. 

 I'm still unfashionably drawn to Tull's great decade during the 70's and I'm not embarrassed to proclaim this loudly.
