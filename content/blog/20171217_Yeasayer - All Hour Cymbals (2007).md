### This wonderfully cheerful, possibly life affirming, record comes courtesy of a random glance at my CD's this afternoon. It's Summer, it's hot and this bigger than life recording does the trick nicely.

 I won't even attempt to categorise or rate it however, I just felt compelled to play it. This music is about as random and surprising as my selection process.

 May life continue in the same vein. Intermittent states of unexpected pleasure and reward,Â punctuated only fleetingly by reality.
