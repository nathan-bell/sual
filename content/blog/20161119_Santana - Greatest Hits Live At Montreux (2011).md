### On Blu-ray 

 Five bucks! Well $4.98 really.

 While not a great fan of the last few decades, this great concert from 2011 covers much of his early catalogue with some more contemporary surprises thrown in. Superbly captured - it looks great and sounds even better. 

 Uplifting and spiritual, it's a a powerful tonic. The antithesis of World Trump. Go Mexico Go!!
