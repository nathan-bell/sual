### Another stunning hi-res recording. This time from the world's best exponent of Swedish psychedelic progressive extreme folk metal.   
  
This is an album that would not offend anyone except maybe the hardcore Swedish death metal die-hard who considers this record the moment Opeth sold their souls in favour of enlightenment and creativity. I'm so pleased they did but really the signs were already in evidence in their masterpiece "Blackwater Park" which preceded this record. 

 Hey people, get off your musical high horses and listen outside your typical musical genres, you might be pleasantly surprised.
