### These were strange days indeed! If you haven't already listened to Cocteau Twins you won't ever be ready to listen to Cocteau Twins. End of story.

 Reading recent user reviews on Allmusic reinforces this belief. You really had to be there. 

 While there's no discernable language (it's just mumbo jumbo), Elizabeth Fraser's vocals are the epitome of voice as instrument.

 Listening to the track "Amelia" puts me in a completely catatonic state.

 Still fucking astounding after all of these years!!!!!!!!!
