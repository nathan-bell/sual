### I've just finished watching the 80 minute Game Of Thrones battle scene (Episode 3 Series 8). I'm not an obsessive GOT fan but it is brilliant television all the same.

 Tonight was all the more remarkable for it's superb soundtrack. Amidst the supposedly unresolvable onscreen carnage (no spoilers here bro!) was some of the most sensitive and beautiful music I've possibly ever experienced in a soundtrack.

 I'm not sure what exactly inspired me to reach for this, originally it was Phaedra, but I ended up playing the wrong disc. It was very worthwhile however despite the error - the track "Cold Water Canyon" and Edgar Froese's fine guitar playing took me back to my happy place.
