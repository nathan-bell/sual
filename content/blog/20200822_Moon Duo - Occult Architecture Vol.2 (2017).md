### Another sonic gem from Portland's Ripley Johnson (Wooden Shjips) and Sanae Yamada.    
  
Some very tasty and oh-so-spacey guitar playing over hooky keyboards and some great drum work from John Jeffrey, elevate this to a thing of mesmeric beauty.   
  
As with all Moon Duo records, this starts getting spiritualised.
