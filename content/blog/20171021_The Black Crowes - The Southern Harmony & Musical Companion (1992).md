### This is a real flash back to the early 70's.

 Rod and Ron and the boys crossed with the sloppy tightness of Mick and Keith's lot. Take "Remedy" for example - this would sit quite comfortably on "A nod is as good as a wink ... to a blind horse" or "Get yer ya-ya's out"

 Just two or three tracks grace the four sides making this one of the more interactive slabs of vinyl in my collection.
