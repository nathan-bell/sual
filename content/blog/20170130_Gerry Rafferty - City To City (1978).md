### I just couldn't resist getting this widely acclaimed, newly remastered record on vinyl for the measly price of $15.

 The only downside, Paul Henry's favourite song, the second song on this record, is "Baker Street". Once you get past that nearly unsurmountable realisation, it's a faultless pop album for all of the ages.

 "Baker Street" IS a remarkable song, but so is every other song. Impossibly good.
