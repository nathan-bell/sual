### Mojo Presents A Tribute To The Cure.  
  
There's no doubt about it, the Cure wrote a ton of brilliant songs, this Mojo Magazine compilation proves it.  
  
From Dinosaur Jr's grungy "Just Like Heaven" through to a ultra-dirgy "Faith" by Nadja, there's another 13 fabulous, completely re-muxed versions of Cure songs.
