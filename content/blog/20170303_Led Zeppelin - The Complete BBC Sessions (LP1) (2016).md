### Ain't nothing but the blues. Great early recordings from a bunch of hairy English blues obsessives. With the exception of The Who, has there ever been a more devastating outfit than this bunch of ruffians?

 These early recordings, on 10 sides of pristine vinyl, which I just had to pick up in London on the day of there re-release, are just brilliant. What totally stands out for me though is John Bonham's amazing drumming. No one comes close.
