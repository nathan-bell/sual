### "Remember where you were yesterday" is a sentiment conveyed in the liner notes on this record dedicated to founding member and drummer Jon Brookes, who died of a terminal illness just prior to its recording.  
  
The Charlatans have always been a consistently great band and this mellow dedication to their fellow band member is beautifully produced and performed.  
  
Tim Burgess, their charismatic leader is also a bit of a musicologist who has written a couple of really great books. "Telling Stories" which is about his band exploits and "Tim Book Two: Vinyl Adventures From Istanbul To San Francisco", is about music that has impacted on his life. It coincides with the release of the similarly titled and equally fabulous, double vinyl compilation. Of course I own a copy on white vinyl.

 Modern Nature was recently purchased for $2 from the Red Shed.
