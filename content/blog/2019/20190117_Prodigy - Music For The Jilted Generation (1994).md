### A classic dance/drum'n'bass/rock/metal cross-over record that absolutely slam dunks all of the big beats, electronic riffage and squelchy brilliance. 

 We lost a past "Shut Up And Listen" member because of this band (notably "Smack Your Bitch Up"). This record gives me another great opportunity to listen to the wonderful "Poison". 

 It never ceases to be exhilarating. "I got the poison, I got the remedy..."
