### Another fantastic record from the world's most forgotten band. Criminally ignored but now highly revered. 

 A new documentary, ["Walking in the Opposite Direction"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI5xxXvB_Bs&amp;t=79s), about Adrian Borland, the enigmatic but ultimately tragic leader of The Sound, is about to be released.

 I've been a fan from day one - when it really mattered.
