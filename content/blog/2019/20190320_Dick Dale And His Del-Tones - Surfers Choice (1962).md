### **16th March 2019 - RIP Dick Dale.**

 Richard Anthony Monsour, born in Massachusetts in 1937, was revered as one of the most influencial guitar players and as a bonus, the God Daddy of surf music. 

 I'd seen this record at TWH in the vinyl bin and thought it's good to listen to/purchase music in context, not just buy willy nilly. This is definitely a rock artifact that warrant's being in my collection.

 Tarantino's all over this.
