### If you haven't listened to this band, I urge you to drop everything and do so right now! 

 Start with this fantastic record, circa 1972, then work your way up from 1969's "Monster Movie" through to 1973's "Future Days".

 I guarantee your musical horizons will crumble before you. It might even be a WTF moment!

 Aside from the astounding music, Damo Suzuki is one of my top 10 vocalists. 

 Mark E Smith even wrote a song about him "I am Damo Suzuki". Mark E Smith is also one of my top 10 vocalists.
