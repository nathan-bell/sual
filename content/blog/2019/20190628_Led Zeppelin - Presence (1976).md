### With Robert Plant confined to a wheel chair recuperating from a serious motor accident, and John Paul not tickling the ivories so much, it's the Bonham and Page show.

 It's a relentless, thunderous cacophony bereft of acoustic guitar or keyboards. Its the opener "Achilles Last Stand" that always steals it for me.

 I've always had a soft spot for this record - it's 1976 and the vitriol of the Pistols is at full tit. For some reason this record survived my anti dinosaur clean out.
