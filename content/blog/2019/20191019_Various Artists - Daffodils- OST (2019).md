### Another cheapie from The Warehouse. As I've stated before, you need to loiter there at least once a week and you will usually be handsomely rewarded.

 picked up this great soundtrack of re-worked iconic Kiwi songs on Daffodil yellow vinyl for $20. It's all very tastefully done and on the right side of not being naff.

Kimbra's all over this, so that was another great selling point. There's a fantastic medley of "There is No Depression in New Zealand" and "Jesus I Was Evil".
