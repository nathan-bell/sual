### A beautiful return to form for Paddy McAloon. A cast-aside solitary CD recently (re)-discovered in a Red Shed bargain bin.

 There's absolutely no let up in quality from his (Prefab Sprout's) earlier masterpeices "Steve McQueen" (1985), "Jordon: The Comeback" (1990) and the astounding "I Trawl The Megahertz" (2003).

 While not prolific over the last 35 years, the brilliance of these records repay the listener many times over and this music lingers on majestically for decades.
