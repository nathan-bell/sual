### This record is like your very own private audience with Bill Callaghan. The songs are intimate and slightly discomforting, but it's always very, very engaging.  
  
Mostly acoustic, there's some exquisite lap steel and upright acoustic bass throughout. It's all tied together with Bill's hugely expressive and rich voice. Talk-quiet at times but delivered like he's sitting right in front of you.  
  
I really thought I wasn't going to like this record. I'm quick to proclaim that this is a beautiful record - both musically and lyrically.
