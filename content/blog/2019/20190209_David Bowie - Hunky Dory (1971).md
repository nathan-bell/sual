### There's possibly nothing in my entire collection that is as ageless as this masterpiece. The fact that my son [Peter listened to this in his car on his wedding day](http://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2019/1/6/david-bowie-hunky-dory-1972) speaks volumes.

 Far too young to appreciate this as a pre-tweeny, it would most certainly come to have a huge influence on my ever expanding musical landscape in later years.

 I love Rick Wakeman's piano playing throughout this record. Later remastering really brings out some sensational muscianship. 

 Incidently, the acoustic piano he did play was Trident Studio's Bachstein grand built in 1898.
