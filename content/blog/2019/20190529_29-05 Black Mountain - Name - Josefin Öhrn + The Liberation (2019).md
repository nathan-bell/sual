### Having a 5 hour bus trip ahead of me to contend with works out to be the perfect opportunity to listen to a couple of new records courtesy of Tidal.

 I've given up listen to music on an iPhone and am instead using a Samsung S8 Android phone for significantly better audio. (A nice little prize a few months ago at a "Spark" presentation).

 While Black Mountain's new album is brilliant as expected, it's Josefin Ohrn's record which totally rips the old nightie.
