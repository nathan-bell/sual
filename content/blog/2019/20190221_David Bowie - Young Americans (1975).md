### The single "Young Americans" was a real surprise when I first heard it on the radio. While the R&B sound was hinted at on "David Live" I don't think anyone was expecting this.

 I probably spent a lot of time revisiting his earlier albums at this time so it was a bit of a stop gap time. There were a few naff songs "Across The Universe" is a bit icky but not ... hideous.

 An average time for a Bowie fan but fuck me - things were about to change big, big time!
