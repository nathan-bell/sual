### It's always a bit of an experience getting Lana's new big chunk of vinyl onto your own turntable.

 Arriving by courier this very afternoon, it's a big double gatefold package encasing two heaving 180g records. Always the drama queen she's just begging, pleading to be heard on the cover.

 Listening to any of her albums on CD just doesn't seem right.
