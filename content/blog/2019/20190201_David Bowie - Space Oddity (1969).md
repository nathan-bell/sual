### I'm breaking out the Bowie box sets this February. It's wall-to-wall studio Bowie records only this month - starting with this, his first "proper" album through to 1980's "Scary Monsters".

 That's where any significant artistic appreciation I had ended and Bowie the mega-middle-of-the-road global superstar started to emerge. 

 It's not a record I have played a lot over the years, possibly because of its folky leanings, but there's some brilliant moments throughout. There's also a hint of some heavy rock just waiting to burst out.

 Mick Ronson had yet not joined the band by then, but may have been responsible for some hand claps on the track "Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud" when visiting Trident studios to visit his new friend.   
  
A hugely significant friendship and artistic partnership had been unleashed.
