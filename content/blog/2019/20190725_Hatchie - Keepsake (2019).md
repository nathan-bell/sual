### I was (and still am) a big fan of the dirgy, ethereal, dreamy sounds of mid-eighties Cocteau Twins, Lush, Ride and the collective sounds of This Mortal Coil.

 While this has more of a pop edge, it's buried deep in the murk. The slightly off-kilter cover matches the music beautifully. If it wasn't gifted to me by my good friend Maurice, I would have missed this great record.
