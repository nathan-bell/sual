### I had a few turntable issues this evening which nearly derailed my listening pleasure. I eventually tracked it down to being an interconnect cable issue.

 I was seriously concerned as this classic record needs all of the bandwidth your system can muster. It really has stood up to the test of time and must be clearly considered as one of the most significant records of the 70's.

 Eno and Ferry were at logger heads regarding the direction the band needed to take - it really shows, and definitely for the better!
