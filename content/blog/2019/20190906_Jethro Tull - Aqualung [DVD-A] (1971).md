### Iâ€™ve been tweaking my new stereo system in the lounge lately. (No more heaving Stonehenge down my stairs every 6 months to host a Shut Up and Listen session!). 

 I needed something familiar, and diverse, that covered a wide range of musical genres (rock, folk and orchestral) to compare the sonic (r)evolution of this space. 

 It's very rewarding when you gets things oh so right. This high res version of one of my seminal records is a great reference recording.
