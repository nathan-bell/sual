### It's taken all of the last 25 years to find a proper version of this record with the correct unadulterated track listing. 

 While I'm grateful for several "enhanced" "remastered" and "deluxe" editions over the years with a myriad of bonus tracks and rearranged track sequences, this is the “proper” version I grew up with.

 This still rumbles along like a gigantic freight train.
