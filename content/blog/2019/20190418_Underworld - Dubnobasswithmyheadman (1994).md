### Cabaret Voltaire sounded like a precursor to the Underworld sound way back in the late 70's, early 80's. While not nearly as accessible they were the original conventional noise assassins.

 That's what probably attracted me to these later day, edgy electronic maestros. While never a big fan of trance and house, these dudes take the CV sound to a different level but retain the same spirit.

 This needs to be played at visceral rattling volumes. I picked up the 2xCD deluxe edition for a couple of bucks.
