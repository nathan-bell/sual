### Sunday afternoon is not a time to get the heavies out. Something soft and bouncy is called for.

 Hot Chip is a London band reportedly on the fringes of dance music and whatever the fuck "alternative" music is? 

 I hate it when you go into a record store and things are defined by genre. (OK there aren't many record shops in this neck of "The Wood" (nice!)) and Smithies does a good job of NOT categorising things.

 But elsewhere just put the fuckers in broad categories and don't use the word "alternative" for anything!! (BTW now that I'm in my 60's, my inner curmudgeon is truly kicking in).

 I've had a listen and it's ok. It's not up there with my 2 favourite Hot Chip records "Made In The Dark" and "One Life Stand" but  that's the great thing about Tidal - it's not always a keeper.
