### Thereâ€™s a lot of syrupy dream pop pouring out of my speakers this morning as I ease into the day with this treasure. (another great record I've been listening to sporadically and on the same musical continuum is Lower Dens. (more on them later)

 This double 45rpm LP glow-in-the-dark package is a sturdy cardboard monster that just doesn't fit any form of plastic outer protection.

 Being slightly non-conforming sums up Beach House  through and through. 

 There are many imitators but this group is definitely the real deal.
