### My (not so) recent trip to Melbourne yielded some surprising good Aussie music that continues to reward.

 One of my favorites was Dope Lemon's "Smooth Big Cat" on pretty picture disc vinyl - it's just fantastic!!. (Dope Lemon is Angus Stone's alter ego).

 I'd brushed Angus & Julie Stone aside in the past thinking they were a couple of country and western hicks from the back blocks of Victoria.

 I couldn't be more wrong. A quick search for them on Tidal and literally a few minutes later I've got some pretty impressive ear candy flowing from my speakers. 

 Not content with a single listen, I played this through twice.
