### Another cracking good record from our neighbours across the ditch.   
I didn't know what to expect when I first put this on. With a name like Jack River, I was expecting some hairy dudes from the back blocks of Bogan-ville 

 In fact Jack River is the alter ego of Holly Rankin and not at all blokey.
