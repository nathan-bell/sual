### Full title - The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table 

 What the holy fuck was I listening to back in the early 70's?! 

 Pretentious bollocks from privileged Brits that's what - not even Johnny Rotten would be bothered to wipe his arse with this stuff.

 This record might have been single-handedly responsible for the emergence of punk in the UK a few months later.

 You know what though, it's strangely seductive and Rick Wakeman is the undisputed mother fucker of all keyboard players.
