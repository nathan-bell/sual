### Here it is! Not my favourite Bowie record by any stretch but definitely in my most important records of all time collection. 

 I was a bare-arsed 13 year old when this bitch of a record ear wormed it's way into my head, courtesy of my big sister.   
  
The first track I ever heard was "Time" on side two which completely fucked up any teenage/prepubescent sensibilities. This music was just so decadent. Mike Garson's piano playing was also fucking jazz - what was that all about?   
  
My reasonably conservative musical roadmap took a complete U-turn with this record. I have never fully recovered.
