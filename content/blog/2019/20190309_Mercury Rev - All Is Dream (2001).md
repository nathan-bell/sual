### Nothing short of profound, this turn-of-the-new-millennium record, with ostentatious string arrangements by Tony Visconti, is a beautiful mess. 

 I'd never be one to recommend Mercury Rev's singular vision and introspective execution as a "must have" for any one's music collection. For me, it's absolutely essential.

 Track One "The Dark Is Rising" is getting an airing at Tuesday's "Shut Up And Listen" session.
