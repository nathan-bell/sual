### In Concert At The Royal Albert Hall

 2018 was an epic year for me in many ways. Add a live Steven Wilson gig in Auckland into the mix and it's an icing-on-the-cake moment.

 Imogen, my youngest, smuggled this Blu-ray/2 CD set into the country from the soon to be defunct HMV on Oxford Street in London. There's not a shit show of it ever getting a NZ release.

 While this is a great memento of his 2018 tour - I think the show I witnessed on that balmy Monday evening completely kicked this gig into touch.
