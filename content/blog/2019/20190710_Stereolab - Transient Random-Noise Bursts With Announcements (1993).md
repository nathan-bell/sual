### On pristine clear vinyl

 Another big slab of early Stereolab. Unrefined and noisy, it's a fantastic and very unsettling journey.

 Jenny Ondioline in all of it's 18 minute mesmeric glory, absolutely hits the sweet spot.

 Three sides in (of six) and it's simply too much to go any further. It's a record one must chunk or face the consequences.

 It's the antithesis of anti-rock music. I played "Achilles Last Stand" to rekindle any wavering commitment to the conventional "rock" aesthetic.
