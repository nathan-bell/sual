### I'm always a bit reluctant to lock into the old mainstream dinosaurs from yesteryear just in case I completely lose my street cred.

 Occasionally, and at the right price, I come across stuff I just can't resist. Trawling the lean pickings at the Red Shed yielded this (apparent) classic from the Moodys.

 A beautifully packaged, gatefold sleeve and 180g chunk of vinyl for the paltry price of 5 Lattes. 

 It certainly lives up to it's hype and while dated ever-so-slightly in production, it's an absolute aural delight from start to finish.
