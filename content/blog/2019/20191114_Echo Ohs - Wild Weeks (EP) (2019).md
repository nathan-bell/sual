### I heard "New Music with Grant Smithies" for 11th Oct 2019 via podcast this morning. One group particularly stood out for me. The Echo Ohs out of Auckland.

 I immediately downloaded it to my iPhone and am now listening via Tidal. Don't fight it Marsha. A brilliant and highly listenable mish mash of throw-the-kitchen-sink at it then add lots of reverb!  

 This stuff gives me hope. Check out Smithies every second week on Radio NZ. All available via podcast and download. There are real treasures to be found.
