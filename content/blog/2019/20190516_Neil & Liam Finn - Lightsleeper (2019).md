### I just couldn't resist buying this big slab of reduced-price, double vinyl, completely unheard on one of my now rather rare excursions into the big red shed.

 I instantly regretted it once I started reading reviews soon afterwards. However, and it's a biggie! If you are expecting a Neil Finn record you will probably be sorely disappointed. If like myself, you are familiar with and prefer Liam's psych-tinged experimentation, expect some great off-beat and soothing ear candy.   
  
While it does have some melodic Neilisms, it's definitely Liam's record. Sounding at times like something from the Wilco catalogue it's actually a rather joyous and unexpected Pleasure.
