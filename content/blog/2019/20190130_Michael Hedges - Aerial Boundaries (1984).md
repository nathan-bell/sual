### Ok I admit it, I dabbled with New Age music! Luckily it was a fleeting indiscretion that only came about from exposure to a couple of Windham Hill samplers.

 I was fortunate however to discover the utterly unique guitar playing of Michael Hedges. Unfortunately, I no longer own it on vinyl, (I gave it away like so many others in the early 00s), so am streaming it via Tidal.

 It sounds absolutely astounding. Highly recommended for any music collection.
