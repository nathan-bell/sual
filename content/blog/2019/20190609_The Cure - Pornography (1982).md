### The Cure at their bleakest. This record, the third record in a trilogy of misery, "17 Seconds" and "Faith" preceded this, makes a lot more sense in these days of utter dispair.

 The trio of muscians makes for a stripped-back-to-basics, raw experience. Robert Smith's vocals are undoubtedly the most idiosyncratic and unique voice in all of rock music.

 His guitar playing is also without comparison. Essential. Just as Robert Smith wanted, nearly unlistenable.
