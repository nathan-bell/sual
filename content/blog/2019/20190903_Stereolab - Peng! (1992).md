### Fantastic debut record from a band I couldn’t do any sort of justice by trying to describe.

 Led by French vocalist Laetitia Sadier, this just oozes cool. It’s awash with .. please add clever, all encompassing superlatives here.  But it’s all about THAT voice and THAT organ sound and that Krautrock noise.   It shouldn’t work and it’s a genuine fucking miracle that it works at all. 

**Please note. This is not my best effort in describing things but in reality I just can’t.**

 The new packaging and clear vinyl just adds to the overall class of this outfit. I’m currently mopping up everything they ever touched.
