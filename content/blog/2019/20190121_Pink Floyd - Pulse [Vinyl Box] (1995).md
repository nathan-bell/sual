### Ok, more "Dad" rock this evening but there's a good story behind this one that involves The Big Red Shed.

 While browsing the vinyl bins recently I came across this beast of a box set newly remastered on 4 big slabs of vinyl. It had a sticker price of $62.

 Clearly there was something wrong. Floyd records, especially the newly minted ones, are notoriously expensive. "Relics" for example, which is a single LP remaster, and sitting right next to "Pulse", was also $62.

 I went ahead and bought it without hesitation, then ventured back the next day to see if this "error" was corrected. It wasn't, and purchased another copy. I just made a $40 profit from selling it on Trade Me.

 I could have made quite a bit more, it actually retails elsewhere at a minimum of $150 but I just needed to share the love. Albeit with a little bit of a profit thrown in.
