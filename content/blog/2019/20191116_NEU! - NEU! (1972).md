### While the Germans are responsible for the abomination that is the [DIN connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_connector) they are also responsible for some of the most influential and amazing music on the planet.

 This stunner (recently purchased on white vinyl) despite being from the early 70's, remains an ageless masterpiece. It's impossible to think that this was made way the fuck back then. BRILLIANT!!!
