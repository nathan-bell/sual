### I haven't finished with Bowie just yet. This record from 1972, coinciding with the release that year of Ziggy Stardust, is my third favourite Bowie record.

 Let's face it, Lou Reed was heading for commercial oblivion until Dave and Mick turned up to rescue him. 

 Mick Ronson's arrangements and musical contributions along with Bowie's inherent hammy/glammy influence and background vocals are essential to the overall production.

 Brilliant songs, brilliant execution â€¦ just brilliant!!!
