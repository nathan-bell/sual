### Thank fucking Christ for this record! This was a big return to form for the Thin White Duke. 

 Nothing was ever conventional for Bowie after this record. While he retained some of the funk and R&B of his previous two records it was the thoroughly calculated and icy-cold execution that took my breath away.

 It was also phase one of his Berlin period and for me, the beginning of the end.
