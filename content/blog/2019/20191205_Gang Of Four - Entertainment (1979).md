### An extraordinary and incendiary relic of the punk/post punk era. Musically and politically, this is such a grab bag of the best bits of the last five years of 70's England.

 Do yourself a favour, don't leave this planet without listening to this at least once. The track "Anthrax" will totally fuck you up! And that's one thing that you don't want to catch.
