### I don't give a tinker's cuss what these dudes are on about but the sonics, bottom end, verbal riffage and discomfort on this record is second to none. 

 You want "Boom, Boom" Kettley - suck on this!

 R&B, Hip Hop, Rap what ever the fuck you define it as these days, is unquestionably where the artists are truly pushing the boundaries of contemporary music.

 This is extraordinary to say the least. I'm well out of my comfort zone but holy capoly, it's an absolute stonker!
