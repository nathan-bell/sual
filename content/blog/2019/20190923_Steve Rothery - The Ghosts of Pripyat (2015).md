### Great guitar-based, instrumental solo record from Marillion guitarist Steve Rothery with special guests Steve Hackett and Steven Wilson. 

 Whilst it may be too  much to do it justice in a single sitting, there’s some great guitar playing from the main Steve. The other two didn’t really need to show up at all. That’s especially the case on “White Pass” where he really showcases his licks.
