### One of my greatest live experiences ever was witnessing Jakob play live at some dodgy club in Nelson to an audience of about 10.

I'm not kidding. Despite a less than ideal turnout, this power trio played like there was a crowd of 500. 
The size of the audience didn't matter to them at all, they unleashed some of the most uncompromising and mesmeric music I have ever heard.
A brilliant, but highly under appreciated band from Napier.
