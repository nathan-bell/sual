### Wedged between "The Stooges" and "Talking Heads" in my highly alphabetasied and well sorted vinyl collection, is this true punk masterpiece. But hey, WTF, no guitars!

 This has more menace than just about anything else ever deemed "punk" with just synth, drum machine and the incredible vocals of Alan Vega.

 If "Frankie Teardrop" doesn't give the heebie geebies, I don't know what will. Just don't listen alone - you have been warned!!!
