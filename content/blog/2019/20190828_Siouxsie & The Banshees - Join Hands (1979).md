### I was really prepared to hate this record. This was one of those Siouxsie & The Banshees records I had never given the time of day.

 Reviews were either glowing or scathing. Seeing this at TWH for fuck all fuelled my obsessive need to own iconic, but often less-than-loved-at-the-time relics from days past.

 This is extraordinary and seemingly a blue print for many a poser for many years that followed.
