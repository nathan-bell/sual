### While I've heard the odd song from the album over the years, I have never listened to this record in it's entirety. Found in a bargain bin a few years ago, this 2001 remaster has sat on the shelf since. I suppose I've just never been brave enough to play this very much (over)hyped album.

 I tell you what though - it doesn't disappoint. As Pitchfork says "Fuck the Doors. This is the truer sound of late-1960s Los Angeles, which was neither a trippy paradise nor a Lizard Kingdom, but a purgatory characterized by paranoia and grievance."

 Having only heard it once, this demands a serious interrogation.
