### Got may latest fix of triple clear vinyl from The Labs this evening - 2LPs actually - that's 6 slabs of mindfucking magic and album numbers 8 and 9!

 A pint at The Free House and a trip to see The Family Jewels and Smithies was practically waiting at the door with my kitty. (Also picked up Nick Cave's "Ghosteen" after reneging for a few weeks)

 There's real treasure, albeit expensive as fuck!, to be found at the local shop for local people.
