### I lugged my big Bowie box #3 down stairs into the lounge this afternoon and played what is probably Bowie's last great album recorded at the arse end of the 80's. (Just think what was happening music-wise back then!?)

 "Ashes To Ashes" is still such an astounding song that it continues to sound unlike anything else I've ever heard.

 While some of his records since the 80's have been average to good, there is absolutely NOTHING that can get even come close to matching his 1970 to 1980 records.
