### Picked up this beautiful gate-fold vinyl record for bugger all from the big red shed.

 (BTW The Warehouse remains my greatest source of musical treasures - now isn't that just a bit sad?!)

 This wee late 60's gem was just begging to join my collection. I didn't know a lot about this record only that it pops up regularly on some of those "highly regarded" lists.

 The opening track "You Can All Join In" is a big surprise and ambushes me right from the start. It's a real mix of genres throughout and nothing short of a great listen. I'll certainly be giving it a few more spins.
