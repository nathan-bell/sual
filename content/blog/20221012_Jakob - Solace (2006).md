### I'm just reading a great, totally self-depreciating and honest book about Steven Wilson's perceived failings as a rock star. 

 Ok, it's agreed, he's no rock star but he's a fantastic musician, producer, band leader (of several ensembles) and a complete music nerd.

 This record I'm playing tonight highlights the universal appraisal/re-appraisal Hawkes Bay's Jakob warrants. Steven Wilson lists the track "Saint" as one of his top 100 tracks. 

 Along with tracks by ABBA, The Cure, Donovan, Led Zeppelin and Massive Attack, there's Jakob's "Saint" wedged between Hawkwind and Jethro Tull.

 As with all Jakob albums, they are to be experienced, not just listened to.
