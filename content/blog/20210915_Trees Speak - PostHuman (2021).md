### Is this album one of those genre-less wonders or an amalgam of everything put through a musical mincer? I really can't make up my mind. 

 One thing is without question though, it is generous and crammed to the brim with a freshness of (old) ideas. And analogue as fuck. 

 These dudes, from Tucson Arizona, create mesmeric, squelchy soundscapes reminiscent of the great Tangerine Dream, but never meander for too long. It's also jazz, krautrock and Wendy Carlos.
