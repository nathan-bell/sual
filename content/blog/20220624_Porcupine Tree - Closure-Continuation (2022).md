### OK, it’s been a good decade since Porcupine Tree shed their seemingly evergreen leaves and ceased to be. Steve Wilson, of course went from strong to stronger and his prolific output continued as a solo artist and wunderkid producer/remaster specialist.

 OK, to me it’s a fabulous return and sonically stunning but its not as essential as peak PT. And never could be.

 I listened to this on Tidal today and it does sound massive. I’ve also ordered the deluxe, CD/Blu-ray version instead of vinyl. This is meant for hi-res. And SW is the best in the business.
