### Literally just out of Kindy, these Oxford youngsters thrust themselves into mid-90's Brit-Pop obsessed England. This debut is surprisingly competent for such tiny tots and remains a highly listenable and classic pop record.   
  
I've just picked up a highly collectible box set of all of their records. As well as lots of rarities, live recordings and demos, there's all of their studio albums on both vinyl and CD. I'm a bit ambivalent about the included vinyl as they are all picture discs in PVC sleeves. They do look fantastic!! There is a bit of noticeable surface noise between tracks but things sound just fine otherwise.   
  
There really is no other way of finding their vinyl elsewhere, so it is a bit of a compromise.    
  
Supergrass really should have been right up their with Blur, Oasis, Pulp and Suede.
