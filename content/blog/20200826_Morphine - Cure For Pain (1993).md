### This Boston three piece make quite the racket, albeit a beautiful one - and it's all done on a two string slide bass, saxophone and drums.   
  
Ok there's a bit of multi-tracking going on but the minimalism creates so much space for front man and bassist, the late and great Mark Sandman, to add some vocal magic to proceedings.   
  
Unfortunately he died of a heart attack while onstage in Rome at the age of 47.   
  
This record, and arguably their best, is testament to his genius.
