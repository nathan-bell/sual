### Fantastic double (black) vinyl re-working of Jane Weaver's 2014 record "The Silver Globe" and 2017's "Modern Kosmology".

 All I can say is my recently purchased Rega MM Fono stage now connected to my upstairs Project Debut and NAD amp is absolutely kicking some serious sonic arse.

 This record proves it! The track "Did You See Butterflies (Loops Variation)" and it's newly installed motorik groove is something I could listen to on endless loop for eternity.
