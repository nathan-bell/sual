### Another fucking 3 years!!!

 Just when you thought "hey this might really happen?", National hit their slow but steady stride with dirty, stinking politics (and probably just too many selfish voters!) and sucker punch the good people of New Zealand.

 I've never really warmed to highly politicised bands but The Manics just seemed the right thing to play post election "blues" (now ain't that ironic!)

 There's a great hidden track - Lennon's "Working Class Hero".Â 

 I'm not sure that it's done the job of purging my dissatisfaction but it's a great listen all the same.
