### Three years on from Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, the world of rock'n'roll was a very different place for me -  I'd discovered Patti Smith, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed.
  
I'm not exactly sure when Jonathan Richman turned up on my timeline, but his record "Jonathan Richman And The Modern Lovers" from 1976, did have an immediate and profound affect. 

The avalanche that was punk and new wave, was just around the corner. Clearly the "do-it-our-way" Americans, like Jonathan Richmond, and a bloated, unimaginative British music industry, was a significant catalyst. 

This great compilation is a great place to start for anyone delving into his wonderful and sometimes wacky back catalogue.
