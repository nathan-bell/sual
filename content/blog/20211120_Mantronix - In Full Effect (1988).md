### After gifting my old turntable to my daughter Imogen and partner Tim in Wellington, they have now been plunged into the world of pain that is collecting and listening to vinyl.

 A visit to Smithies resulted in the purchase of some startup essentials, Beach House, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Rolling Stones and Hole. I didn't want to feel left out so scored this mid-80s USA pressing. Grab it or it's gone is my motto.

 Mantronix are duo rappers/mixers Kurtis "Mantronix" Kaheel and MC Tee who deliver some of the best beats of this (any probably any) era. Being so far ahead of their time, they appealed to me more as electronic revolutionaries than run-of-the-mill rappers.

 This still sounds incredible.
