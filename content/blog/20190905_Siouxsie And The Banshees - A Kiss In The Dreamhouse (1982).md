### Another beautifully eclectic and somewhat experimental offering from the post-punk, gothic sweethearts.

 Siouxsie Sioux is in fine voice and John McGeoch (ex Magazine guitarist) is now fully ensconced in the band.

 It's great to revisit this stuff with the realisation that this group were well ahead of the pack. They were also probably fully responsible for launching The Cure's career.
