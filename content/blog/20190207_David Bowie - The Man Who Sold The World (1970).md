### I've waited what seems like an eternity to play this. I've just returned from a week away and within the first hour of being home I feel a real anticipation that turns into necessity, to get on with playing Bowie's second record.

 While it's a planned event in keeping with my chronological work through of Bowie's first 15 albums, it's such a great moment when that needle hits the groove.

 it's a sentimental favourite of mine that I never tire of listening to. Mr Ronson most definitely "arrives" on this record. It rocks hard and kicks his folk persona (temporarily at least) into touch.

 I always did prefer the old black cover though
