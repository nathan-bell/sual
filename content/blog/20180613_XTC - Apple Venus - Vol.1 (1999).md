### I finally got to watch the fantastic XTC documentary ["This Is Pop"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7465694/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) today  via some dodgy streaming service (ok, I was desperate!)  
  
It certainly lived up to my high expectations and reinforced just how brilliant Andy Partridge and Colin Moulder were in creating a consistency of song writing that is only matched by the Beatles.  
  
This record is an example of that quality. It's right up there with their best records and their best records are at the pinnacle of English rock and pop music.  
  
Do yourself a favour dig through their back catalogue. It's an unbelievably rich and rewarding treasure trove.
