### This is where it all started with me and the Lizzy boys. The best dual guitar attack since Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter ambushed Lou's "Rock'n'Roll Animal".  
  
Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham instantly became my biggest guitar heroes on the strength of this album. Just listen to the track "Suicide" it's fucking brilliant.  
   
While Phil Lynott was the cool, black messiah, it was the guitar duelists that got all of my attention.   
  
The Lizzy albums from 1975 to 1979 were all classics. This is right up there with "Jailbreak".
