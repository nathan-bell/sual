### A big hefty chunk of vinyl playing at 45rpm, a "hidden" track on side one you play backwards, a pop-up cardboard engineer in the recording studio inside the lavish gatefold cover, and lots of a complete off-kilter, genre-bending tunes/experiments throughout! 

 Just another day at the office for Wales' finest. What is clear with the Super Furry Animals is they have hardly played a bum note their entire 25 year career. They just keep on giving auditory pleasure.
