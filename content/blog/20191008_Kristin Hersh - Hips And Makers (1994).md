### What a fucking amazing record! What a fucking amazing woman! When the track "Your Ghost" starts off, my goose bumps are the size of golf balls!

 This is a call and response song with Michael Stipe helping out. It's an absolutely perfect match. I was tempted to put on repeat all evening but will sneak another play later.

 A true highlight during my lifetime was seeing her fronting Throwing Muses in London back in 2014.
