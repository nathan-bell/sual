### Now this record is just frightening! As previously mentioned, I've been watching the latest/last series of Twin Peaks and every episode gets stranger, darker and more bewildering than the previous episode.

 It's the sort of adventure where you really don't give a flying fuck where it's headed or what it's about, it's just about "enjoying" the journey. (It's a complete mind-fuck to be frank!)

 While this scary, abrasive beast of a record from 30 years ago could easily soundtrack some of those events unfolding, it's a similar non-linear adventure where you are praying for it to end but at the same time not wanting it to stop.

 Richard H Kirk, of Cabaret Voltaire fame, is the cat's bollocks on this. However, itâ€™s the thing of nightmares.
