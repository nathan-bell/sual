### I was never a Marillion fan but when you are confronted with a brand new, mint copy of their highly regarded 2nd album for $9.98 what do you do? It's good for a punt I reckon?

 For the price of a scone and coffee you have a vinyl recording that might just keep on giving.

 Often compared to early Genesis, they do sound re markedly like Gabriel era Genesis. Perhaps a bit too much synthesiser (hey its 1984!!) but the (melo)drama of it all unfolds beautifully. A great surprise actually.
