### The six years between 1976 and 1982 probably had the greatest impact on my musical roadmap. 

 I had a big preference for British punk and new wave around that time and this evolved into electronic abrasiveness and the intentionally (very) unconventional.

 This record really fucked me up though as it was all of those things in one extraordinary cacophony of found sounds, electronic flurries, very clever cut-up and funky bass lines.

 It still remains untouchable for sheer audacity and originality.
