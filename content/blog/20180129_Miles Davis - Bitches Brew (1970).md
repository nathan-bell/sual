### I was really hesitant about playing this record today and as I later found out, for very good reason.  
  
On a morning walk with the dog, I listened to my favourite podcast, [Marc Maron's WTF](http://www.wtfpod.com/).Â  It was an interview with Paul Shaffer.  
  
In it, Paul Shaffer mentioned his time playing with Miles Davis (albeit, rather briefly) and some of his insights into working with the man. *"Never play the root note"* was one of his mantras apparently.  
  
During this interview, Bitches Brew also got a mention. Any how, this got me thinking. I've never played this iconic jazz record despite acquiring a pretty impressive 3CD/1DVD box set of "Bitches Brew" when in London a couple of trips ago. (It only cost me a few pounds so felt I couldn't lose.)

 "Here goes, be brave" I thought to myself as I dropped the needle on the first track. (figuratively speaking that is - it was actually a CD)  
  
Chris, as the Shut Up and Listen group's number one jazz man, I have a wonderful gift for you, a 3CD/1DVD box set of Miles Davis's "Bitches Brew". It's yours any time you want it!

 My experience with Miles Davis's "Bitches Brew" lasted all of 10 minutes.
