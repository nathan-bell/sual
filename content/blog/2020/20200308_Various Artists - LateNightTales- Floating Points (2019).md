### I've been really enjoying mix tapes and compilations over the last few years. The best collections tend to expose one to other artists, genres and sometimes entire worm holes for further investigation. 
  
This record is one of the latest ["LateNightTales"](https://latenighttales.co.uk/) collections and is curated by Sam Shepherd AKA Floating Points. 

There's not a single artist I have come across so hereâ€™s a real adventure. 

As you'd imagine from the title it's not an ear bashing but more on the ambient/electronic/jazz side of the spectrum. It's all rather sleep inducing in places (and that's a good thing) as it takes you to a happy place.
