### You can thank not taking the time to properly programme stations on the car radio and the holiday break for my two latest indiscretions. (I’ll leave the other one up my sleeve).  
  
Their's numerous Dad rock stations at play these days, in my case it's mainly "Hauraki" and "The Sound".  My go to has usually been the National station to keep abreast of things with at least some semblance of balance to reporting. However, over the holiday period I've been listening to mainstream rock music while impartiality takes a rest.    
  
Well this old stuff is addictive and aside from Billy Joel, it's consistently great.   
Tom Petty's greatest hits is a direct result of recent listening.   
(This could possibly be the greatest, greatest hits collection ever - and worth the relatively cheap price for the track “Mary Jane’s Last Dance” alone).   
  
I have incredibly vivid memories of playing the debut album in my friends bedroom in Hastings in 1976 and being absolutely blown away by it. It was on constant rotation for weeks.
