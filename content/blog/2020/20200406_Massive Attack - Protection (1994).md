### While it's hard to argue that this, their second record, is made of the same greatness that came before on "Blue Lines", it just fails to rip my nightie this evening.   
  
Unfortunately, and I'm being self-referential here, I was really more focused on trying to rescue my munted website as I set about to do some spring cleaning.   
  
Lesson learnt - hurry up and slow down and have a plan.  This is still a really great album - just don't be preoccupied with other things.
