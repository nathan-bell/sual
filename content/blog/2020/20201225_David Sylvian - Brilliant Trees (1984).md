### It's hard to know what to play on Christmas day. It's not a day to go all out hardcore or overtly political. It's also a day NOT to play anything representative of Yuletide.

 This beautiful and reflective album from 1984 is just the ticket. This wonderful record is David Sylvian's post-Japan breakup record and pretty much continues where "Tin Drum" left off.

 Bought second hand just yesterday, this German re-pressing sounds fantastic. The lineup of muscians is equally astounding including Ryuichi Sakamoto, Jon Hassell, Mark Isham, Danny Thompson amongst other greats. 

 Very vinyl-worthy.
