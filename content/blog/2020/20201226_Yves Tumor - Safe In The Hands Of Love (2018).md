### Nothing prepares you for this. The beats are big, and at times there's a semblance of texture, structure and a hint of song craft. Other than that you are on your own. Beautifully recorded and split over 4 sides of vinyl - everything about this is magnificent.

 Under the terms of reference of "The Forensic Records Society"(and soon to be introduced to our own SUAL group) there's no conversation or analysis while proper listening takes place. (there's been some slippage lately)

 This is a prime candidate for shutting the fuck up and just listening. Don't over analyse - just enjoy the moment. It's a wonderful investment of your time.
