### I really forgot I even had this in my record collection when I went hunting for something substantial today.  And this remastered gem on Antarctic Ice Shelf-thick vinyl IS truly substantial.   
  
I think I picked this up along with another swag of vinyl when they had a yellow sticker sale.   
OK, I’m a hoarder but this is a rainy day (figuratively speaking!))    
  
If you want absolute, unequivocal truth that vinyl sounds more alive and vibrant than any other media then get on your bike and sit down in front of my Epiphany speakers and you’ll have one without any doubt.     
  
Just loving my stereo today!
