### Bob is very angry! Hunkered down in his bunker while America burns and Trump tries to chip his way out, Bob creates some of the most vitriolic, heart-on-his-sleeve commentary he's ever recorded.

 35 mins of spit and bile is over in a flash.

 After listening to this, a further purge was warranted. The bad taste of honesty quickly removed by an earth shattering "Nobody's Fault But Mine".
