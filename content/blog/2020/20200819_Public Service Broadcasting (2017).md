### It’s wet and cold outside this afternoon as this tribute to Welsh miners spins on my turntable.   
  
In contrast to the bleakness of the elements, it’s warm and cosy inside as the fire pushes out some serious heat. My point is, I’d rather be where I am than shoved down some dark, dirty old pit in Wales.    
  
While this music is meant to be performed live along with newsreels and found footage, something of a specialty for PSB, it certainly stands on its own merits as a serious and very lush piece of music.
