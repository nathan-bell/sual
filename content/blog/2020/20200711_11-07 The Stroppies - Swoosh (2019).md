 This really could be Dunedin circa 1982.   
  
Despite an Australian twang as wide as The Tasman Ocean there’s a definite The Bats/The Clean jingly/jangly groove emanating these Melbournians.   
  
However, unlike everything Aussies try and plagiaries or pillage from us, this is an absolute gem of a record that truly shouts out it’s greatness.
