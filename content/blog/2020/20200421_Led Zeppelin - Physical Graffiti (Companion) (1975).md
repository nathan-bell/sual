### Physical Graffiti remains one of my all time "most significant records". I still remember buying this fucker!  I couldn't breath when I dropped that needle for the first time.   
  
I needed something heavy this evening and instantly reached for this MF!  
  
This companion record to the main event is just awesome. There are early versions of "Trampled Underfoot (Brandy & Coke)", "In My Time Of Dying" and "Kashmir", which are astoundingly raw and monumental.   
  
Just fucking amazing.........
