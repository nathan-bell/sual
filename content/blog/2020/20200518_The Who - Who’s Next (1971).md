### I’ve always wanted to re-get this on vinyl (I gave my first LP away in the early 2000s) and was seething with jealousy when fellow shut up and listener, brother Ricardo showed me his big blue. The Who’s, arguably, greatest record on beautiful blue vinyl.

  I would have to ride this out - mediocre black would simply not do. I did look but could never find a copy. My quest was most likely in vain.    
  
Well my friend, that day of reckoning has come, a copy of said record on pretty blue vinyl arrived today on my doorstep. All for grand total of $19.95 from JB-Hifi.  By the way, I also picked up a copy of Zappa’s “Sheik Yerbouti” on double vinyl for the same price.
