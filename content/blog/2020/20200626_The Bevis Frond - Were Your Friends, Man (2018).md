### I'd heard of The Bevis Frond but up until this evening I'd never "heard" The Bevis Frond.   
  
As I now have a tendency to do, I bought this on a spare-of-the-moment impulse at Smithies "Family Jewels" this evening. I just needed my vinyl fix and the cover looked interesting.   
  
Well bugger me what a sensational find it is too - possibly my pick of the year so far along with "The Smoke Fairies" latest.   
  
As I have just discovered, Nick Saloman is one hell of a guitar player and some of his playing ventures into grungy old Neil Young/J Mascis sonics territory. Every single song is an absolute show stopper.   
  
This will be on high rotation and their back catalogue will get hit hard.
