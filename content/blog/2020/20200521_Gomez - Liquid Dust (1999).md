### I can just about tolerate going grocery shopping at Fresh Choice supermarket when they play some classy tunes over the PA system.  
  
I was immediately hooked on one particularly catchy tune the other day as I was browsing for tinned tomatoes. I reached for my "Shazam" app and found it was Gomez performing "We Haven't Turned Around".   
  
I'd always assumed Gomez were an American band but on further research they actually hail from Merseyside in the UK. Fine exponents of Americana they are too.   
  
While it's tasty on top it does run out of flavour as you get deeper into it.    
  
Anyhow this does give me chance to stream from Tidal via my PC, through my Jitterbug USB, unfold into the DragonFly dongle, through the NAD amps analogue inputs for further processing then out to these ears via my B&W speakers.  Easy as!
