### This has been my soundtrack to everything of late.    
  
No, you won't have heard of Jonathan Hultén but you really should as this record is simply extraordinary!!!!  
Released just a few weeks ago, I just can't stop listening to it.   
  
So what if he's the guitarist for Swedish Death Metal Soothsayers "Tribulation" this couldn't be any further on the other end of that particular continuum. That spectrum is the extremest and darkest of growly metal at one end to the ethereal and organic sounds of Tuvian throat singing at the other end.   
  
This is my album of the year so far by a country mile.
