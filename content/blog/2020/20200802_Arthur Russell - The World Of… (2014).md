### This FANTASTIC remastered 2014 compilation on 3 great slabs of vinyl just sounds well…. FANTASTIC!   
  
These 11 tracks, all released as 12” remixes, were clearly made for the dance floors of the late 70’s, early 80’s, but really blur the links between Disco, Classical, Jazz and Dub.   
  
This is not the all limbs flailing across on the dance floor style of music but is more introspective and life-affirming.
