### There's absolutely no in-between with Ms. Newsom. You either love her or loathe her. 

 Personally, I'm firmly in the love her unconditionally camp. Instrumentally and vocally there's no real comparison to anyone else and for any Newsom newbies there's simply no preparation possible at all.   
  
Her 2006 album "Ys" is an absolute masterpiece and on my top 10 for records that are "events" rather than simply recordings. This is also similarly amazing.
