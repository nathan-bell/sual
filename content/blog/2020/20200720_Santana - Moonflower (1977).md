### OK it’s not a “proper” live album - it’s got studio recordings interspersed with the live stuff - but as a 17 year old totally immersed in guitar hero worship, this thing still stings the synapses.   
  
Being 1977, the guitar would not rule for much longer as punk, new wave and the electronic overlords, took hold.  However, the tone and sustain on this still gives me goosebumps.
