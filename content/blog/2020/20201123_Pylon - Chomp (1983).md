### A big box arrived via courier today.   
  
Now here’s something. I  ordered this on Friday morning - it arrived mid Monday morning. Kudos to you Real Groovy Records!

 And OMG what an absolute treasure it is.  This is one of the best box sets I have ever seen and the accompanying 200+ page book, signed by existing band members, is just beautiful.

 Even better, there’s 4 LPs of newly minted, remastered funky punky wonderfulness. Box set heaven personified.

 I just have to ask though - how the hell did I miss this band the first time around?
