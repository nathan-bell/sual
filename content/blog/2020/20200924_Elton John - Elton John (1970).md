### I give Elton's "Your Song" the same respect as I do for Bowie's "Space Oddity".   
  
Both fantastic songs released within 6 months of each other, but the albums from which these songs originated were never on my radar until much later. I was only 10 or 11 years old FFS!   
  
It was really "Honky Chateau" and "Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player" that introduced me to Elton John. It was a relatively short obsession however, Bowie's "Aladdin Sane" was soon to scramble my brain and take me on a completely different trajectory.   
  
While not as important past the mid-70's, the music of Elton John was still a significant part of my life.    
  
I did take the opportunity to buy a special edition of this record on "Record Store Day" and while it's a very serious, young Elton, it is the record that kick-started a phenomenal 6 years that produced 10 brilliant albums.
