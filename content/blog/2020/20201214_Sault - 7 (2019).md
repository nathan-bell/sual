### A punk-funk-soul one-two that leaves you dazed and delighted. That's the headline.

 I just love taking risks with music but at the same time I'm quite hesitant when considering my choices.

 I don't know what I was expecting with this completely unwitnessed/unheard, spontaneous purchase but holy kapoly it's an absolute gem.

 Another no-genre delight that even throws in the kitchen sink.
