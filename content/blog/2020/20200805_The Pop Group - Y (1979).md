### The antithesis of “pop” this is as abrasive and challenging as it gets.   
  
There’s no hiding. The dog is currently nestled under my legs somewhat disturbed by the dissonance.   
  
This is free form jazz punk bereft of any time signature.     
  
As Viv Albertine (of the wonderful Slits and good friend of chief Popee, Gareth Sager) says*"I don't understand why time-keeping is considered such an attribute in western music. African drummers don't play one speed all the way through a piece of music, they speed up and slow down according to the mood, same with Indian music. It's like being told to keep the same speed and rhythm all through sex".*  

 This is not recommended for anyone with a weak heart.
