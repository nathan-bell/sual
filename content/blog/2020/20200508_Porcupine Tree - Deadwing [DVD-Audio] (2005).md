### OK I concede. The only thing better than Porcupine Tree's Deadwing on vinyl is Porcupine Tree's Deadwing on Hi-Res DVD-Audio.   
  
Renown for his production and high resolution recordings, Steven Wilson does not hold back on this beauty.   
  
How this record is not mainstream ala Pink Floyd or Opeth is beyond me!? Astounding from start to finish this would be a great place to be immediately blown away by the best band that no one has heard of.   
  
Heavy, spacious and simply magnificent, this could well be the high water mark for Mr. Steven Wilson. Mind you - I could say that with all of his records.
