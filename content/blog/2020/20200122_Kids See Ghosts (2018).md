### This is a brilliant collaboration between Kid Cudi and Kanye West.  While it's only an 20 minute EP, it does one hell of a lot during those 1200 seconds.   
  
There's more invention in this admittedly, (and yes if you want to be picky), slightly short-changed chunk of vinyl than many musicians/artists would ever dream of.  Its gone under the radar a bit, but this will be on high rotation.   
  
Kayne delivers again!
