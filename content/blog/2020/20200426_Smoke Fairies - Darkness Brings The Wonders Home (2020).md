### I'm just listening to "Coffee Shop Blues" as I'm hearing this Tidal stream for the 2nd time today. Wouldn't a proper cup of barista quality coffee and a cheese scone dripping in butter go down well!    
  
This is another quality release from this Sussex-based duo. Sounding distinctly like folk-infused, American blues, this dirty guitar-based riffy dirge couldn't be further removed from old Blightly.   
  
There's not a weak moment throughout and I could quite easily have this set on repeat for another session or two.
