### Just above the bar code on the back of this new slab of vinyl by Lytteltonâ€™s Nadia Reid it proudly proclaims "Made in New Zealand" in a nice bold font. Continuing my recent run of listening to Kiwi artists, (not consciously I'll have you know, it's just happening) I dropped some notes on this and Avant-Dale Bowling Club's debut.   
  
Nadia Reid is really causing a big stir overseas and has been credited for "saving folk music". This record is far more than just a  "folk" record however.   
  
Beautifully produced, it's a lush and lyrical experience that really asks you to engage with her as she tells her stories. Wonderful.
