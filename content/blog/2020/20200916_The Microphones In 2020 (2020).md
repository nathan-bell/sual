### Douglas R Hofstadter would have a field day with this one.    
Hofstadter's Law states that "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."    
  
At 44 minutes long this “song” in all of its self-referential glory, meets that criteria when you also take into consideration that the song is entirely about itself.   
  
This music demands to be listened on headphones and without interruption.   
Print out the lyrics and become totally engulfed by it all.
