### More dirgey psychedelia from the Wooden Shjips' trippy guitarist and leader Erik Johnson et al.   
  
While it gets a bit samey across several albums, (this is my forth Moon Duo record), it's exactly the samey that I really like!    
  
As for allmusic's less than charitable review - what a load of bollocks!   
This is just the sort of mess I need right now!
