### If you think my time listening to Stereolab is fully exhausted, then think again. This compilation from 1998 is a real cracker. 
  
As it's a mix of non-LP singles, tour 7"s, split singles, special-edition EPs and other rarities there's a real eclectic feel and excitement to proceedings. The guitars and electronics are heavy and the longer-than-usual stretches of cacophony are mesmerising. 

In my mind this is one of their best releases.
