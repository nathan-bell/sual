### Another stunner from the Radiohead front man.   
  
I loved Radiohead's last record, A Moon Shaped Pool,  and it's obvious that this is a hangover from those sessions.   
  
There's lots of big, analogue sounding Synthes, ambient washes and electronic percussion/noize but it's his magnificent voice that becomes the dominant instrument.    
  
I've been listening to a lot of German music from the early 70's lately and this seems like a very comfortable bed fellow.
