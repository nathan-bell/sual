### There is just so much to love about this record. The track "Uh-oh" alone would be worth the price by itself. This newly minted 20th anniversary is one album you really need in your collection. 

 While its clearly a Flying Nun record with New Zealand bones, it also borrows heavily from other NZ bands, Krautrock and the Mark E. Smith's mantra of repetition, repetition, repetition.

 I'd be happy if each and every track was stretched out over a side of vinyl each. I just can't get enough of this wonderful record.
