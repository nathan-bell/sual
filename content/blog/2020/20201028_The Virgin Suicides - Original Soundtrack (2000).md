### I’m loving listening to compilations and movie soundtracks at the moment. A good soundtrack is often as memorable as the film itself and usually provides an eclectic mix of styles and artists. 

 This Record Store Day release on swirly pink vinyl doesn’t disappoint. A dark, coming-of-age film set in 70’s America, artists range from Heart, 10cc, Gilbert O’Sullivan, Todd Rundgren and The Hollies. 

 French band Air provide a couple of more ambient tracks.
