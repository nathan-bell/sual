### I’m half way through Viv Albertine’s very candid 2014 book “Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys”   
  
She was brought into The Slits as the guitar player who had never actually played guitar.   
Despite this minor deficiency, the band were revered as true pioneers of women’s rock and as Pitchfork put it “this album is terribly, terribly important in the history of the rock music and the grand scheme of canonical flippity floo flap.   
  
It’s a surprising good listen and very easy to play spot the influence.
