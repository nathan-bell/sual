### Put on as background music this afternoon while tidying the cave, I was also trying to convince myself that when compared with vinyl, CDs sound like shit. 

This is a wonderful, Sunday afternoon record with lots of orchestration, jangly guitars, frills and spit-clean vocals. To answer the format question, CD vs vinyl, it completely floored me just how fantastic this sounds. 

To elaborate, I've just rearranged my upstairs stereo system, adding my Oppo multiformat player (CD, DVD, DVD-A, SACD, Blu-ray) back into the mix. It has sort of been mothballed without much use. 

Lately, I'd been happy just streaming and playing vinyl while contemplating how to get rid of my massive CD collection. No more. Get the right rig and your investment will reveal itself.
