### Another impulse buy from "Family Jewels".   
  
I mainly bought this for the beautiful crystal clear coloured splattered vinyl but as a secondary bonus the music is a complete breath of fresh air.   
  
Sampa who was born in Zambia, raised in Botswana, lived in California and is now based in Australia, is a real surprise package expressing a myriad of influences.  She immediately reminds me of Nitin Sawhney and M.I.A. and for an obviously worldly 24 year old sound shows incredible maturity in her voice and musical influences.    
  
There's hip-hop, R&B, Jazz, Funk and African infused psychedelia.
