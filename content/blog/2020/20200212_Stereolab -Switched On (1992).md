### This really early collection of singles and EPs that were recorded prior to their first album Peng! shows just how far they haven’t come.  And thank god for that!   
  
While they are more sophisticated, better produced and accessible on later recordings, their hypnotic, economical sound has remained constant.    
  
Put very simply, they don’t waste a lot of notes.
