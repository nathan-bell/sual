### This morning I discovered a wonderful new podcast for the proper music nerd. It's called "[The Album Years](https://podtail.com/podcast/the-album-years/)" and is presented by one of my familiars - Steven Wilson and his close buddy Tim Bowness.   
  
It really should be a mandatory listening requirement for all shut up and listen members.   
  
One of those records mentioned is Van Morrison's "Common One". It's unconventional and challenging, especially if you are used to the 3 to 5 minute song cycle of his previous records. There's two 15 minute tracks for god sakes!  There's also more than nod to jazz.   
  
On very first listening it's an absolutely remarkable piece of music.  This would have simply slipped by without a second thought, or even a first thought for that matter if I hadnâ€™t been convinced to listen to it.  
  
This really emphasises the power of reliable sources of information via the pull-media of podcasts.  You chose what you listen to, when you want to listen to it and know it's more that simply sound bites.   
  
Dig a bit deeper my friends.
