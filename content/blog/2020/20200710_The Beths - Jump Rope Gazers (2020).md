### More vinyl I've never listened to. It's great to just buy stuff like in the old days when you only have reference to music choices courtesy of NME, Melody Maker, Sounds and local music rags like Rip It Up.   
  
None of this streaming palaver or the benefit of hearing on some other digital media. Buying blind with only recommendation and reputation supporting one's decision is classic, old school album acquisition. And I'm loving it!   
  
This record from Auckland Jazz students, The Beth's, is their second release. It's really good and the singer, Elizabeth Stokes sounds a lot like Harriet Wheeler of The Sundays. (Which is nice!)
