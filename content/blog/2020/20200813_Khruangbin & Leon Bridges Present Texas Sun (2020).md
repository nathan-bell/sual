### This is a short and sweet little collaboration between fellow Texan musical pre-Covid tourists.    
  
After gigging around a bit, they decided to hit the studio.   
  
In doing so they have delivered a surprisingly sunny and contagious ray of sunshine in the murk.  

 I even heard the main track “Texas Sun” accompanying the weather one afternoon. The band which remains unpronounceable was never mentioned.
