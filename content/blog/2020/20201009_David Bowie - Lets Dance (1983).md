### If you started your Bowie introduction with this record, that would be a bit unfortunate but palatable at least.  

 It was definitely the beginning of the slide into his own level of mediocrity that lasted the next 10 years. In it's defence however, it's a pretty decent record with three of his strongest songs ever kicking things off.   
  
Not high up on the Bowie register but worth a listen every so often.
