### Newly acquired, this is Record B (now finally out on vinyl) of the wonderful series of early (1972-83) experimental German rock and electronic musik by Soul Jazz Records.    
  
It's a brilliantly diverse compilation that is just chock full of the legends of Krautrock and definitely one of the best places to start that journey.   
  
There's a new compilation coming out in the next couple of months.
