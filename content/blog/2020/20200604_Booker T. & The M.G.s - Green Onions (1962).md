### To test my new computer/USB DAC/amplifier rig, I decided to play a high resolution computer audio file this evening. (A 24 bit/192kbps FLAC file to be precise).   
  
This 1960's gem was close at hand and chosen quite randomly. I hadn't really planned on listening to this for longer that a few minutes, but once things started, it was impossible to stop.    
  
It is no wonder this record is deemed one of the true classics , it sounds absolutely stunning. I'm not just talking audiophile quality, but the actual performance quality of this classic record.    
  
 I've never spent any time with this record, I also have it on vinyl, but it is extraordinary.
