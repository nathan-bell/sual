### There's no getting away from it - Pink Floyd's "The Wall" is quite good.   
  
It's certainly the Waters and Gilmour show with some killer songs amongst the more operatic/filler stuff.  (Maybe, if this wasn’t quite the epic double record it would be more tolerable. It got tiresome in between the brilliant stuff).  It's definitely a record made to be played on vinyl. The sound-stage is huge on this format.   
  
I've been listening to "The Sound" on the car radio lately as I commute to work. (There's a lot of "dad rock" being played but there's a high percentage of truly great tracks) I heard a couple of tracks off this record the other day which prompted me to play it this evening.  I might give it another airing in a few years but it’s not my favourite Floyd record by a long shot.
