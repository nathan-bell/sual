### I just couldn’t resist picking this beauty out of the forever expanding bins of prestige new records at JB-Hifi (at The Hutt) and adding it to my ever increasing haul of vinyl-worthy, North Island souvenirs. 

 After all it’s not often you see a shiny new Throwing Muses record.

 Kristen Hersh has always been a great guitar player (as well as one of my favourite lady singers), but her playing on this record is sublime. 

 I haven’t heard guitar playing this dirty and real for donks. Fantastic!
