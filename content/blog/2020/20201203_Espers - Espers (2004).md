### At home feeling a bit under the weather today.

 Not really in the mood for anything too abrasive so reached for some neo psychedelic alt folk music. As you do. You just can't go wrong with a bit of contemporary English trad folk now can you?!

 Except these dudes are from Philadelphia and in places this record plays like a fuzzed up madrigal group thatâ€™s taken a lot of acid and run amok in the studio. Brilliantly disconcerting.
