### Just a couple of albums to go on my Anglo-French band adventures over the last month. They play live on Tuesday night next week!!! 

I listened to this back in January and without any hesitation would say this is one of their high water marks! 

If I had only 3 Stereolab records to choose from, and despite this being an early compilation, I think this would be one of them. 

They were still a bit under-producted and Mary Hansen's complimentary-to-Laetitia's-vocals is pure gold.
