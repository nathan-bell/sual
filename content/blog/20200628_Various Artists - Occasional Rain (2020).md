 Bob Stanley & Pete Wiggs Present England, the day after the 60's.   
  
This is the follow up to [2017's wonderful "English Weather"](https://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2017/6/18/various-artists-bob-stanley-pete-wiggs-present-english-weather-2017) and another fantastic compilation of English obscurities.  Like the first one, there's definitely an identity crisis going on for most of the tracks during what was an awkward "post-psychedelic, pre-progressive" era. This makes for an utterly fascinating journey.   
  
[ACE Records](https://acerecords.co.uk/)are currently my go to for sensational compilations.
