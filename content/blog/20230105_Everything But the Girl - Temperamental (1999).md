### 1996's "Walking Wounded" and this, their last record as EBTG, have aged very well indeed.

 Moving from acoustic folk/pop music to electrified trip hop and dance was a bit of a bold move. It was, and still is brilliant.

 A sodden "Bay Dreams" is playing out this eventing. It only seems apt to play this. What an absolute banger!
