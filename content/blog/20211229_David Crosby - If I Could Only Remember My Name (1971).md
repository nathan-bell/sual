### Splendid, hippy dippy masterpiece that sounds both completely messed up and singularly focused all at the same time.

 It's a mishmash of styles of the time but totally expected when you consider the roll call of participants.

 It's a slow beginning but once it takes flight is it spectacular. This remaster cut from the orginal analogue tapes sound immense.

 I've only ever heard this in all of its glory on high resolution media. This wonderful repress is even better.
