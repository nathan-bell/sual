### I initially tried to listen to an electronic record (Meat Beat Manifesto) this evening but I just wasn’t in the mood at all. It lasted less than one minute. I needed something more organic. I don’t know what organic looks like but I reckon I know what it sounds like.  
  
This record just feels like it wrote itself using perfection as a template. 

 This particular record, now beautifully remastered (and possibly more organic than ever) featured heavily in my musical listening apprenticeship as a first year teenager.  
  
The first five years of the 1970’s was such an amazing period in the evolution of the pop and rock music that I feel privileged that I lived through it. From my own "being there" experience this was only slightly matched by that post-punk/new wave period in the late 70’s early 80’s.
