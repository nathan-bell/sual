### Gazza just goes from strength to strength. Honestly, I kind of reluctantly bought this new record thinking it's going to be somewhat disappointing after his astonishing 2017 release "Savage".

 I neednâ€™t have worried at all. On very first listen I'm already completely hooked. Some reviews have mentioned it being a bit "samey". Glory be to that - it's like that wonder track you wish would go on forever.

 Sonically it's also quite stunning with a huge soundscape. This record is going to get one heck of a thrashing over the coming weeks.
