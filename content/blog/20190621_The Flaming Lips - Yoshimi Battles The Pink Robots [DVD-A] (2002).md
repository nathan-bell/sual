### Imogen, my youngest daughter who's staying with us for the weekend, randomly selected the letter "F" this evening.

 Without hesitation, I selected The Flaming Lips and this their post millennial masterpiece. Sounding all the better in high resolution DVD-Audio format.

 I remember picking this up at the Warehouse along with a whole batch of other, supposedly end-of-line DVD-Audio discs for about $5 each. (They are rare and valuable items these days) 

 Brilliant from start to finish!
