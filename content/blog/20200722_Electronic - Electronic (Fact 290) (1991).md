 The Smiths and New Order. Two of the most influential bands of the 80’s.   
  
This masterpiece is the bastard offspring of Bernard Sumner and Jonny Marr, two key members of those respective stalwarts of British post punk.     
  
It’s quite uncanny listening to this when you can dissect and split the influence of both artists right down the middle.    
  
Throw in some pop tarts on two of the tracks, namely The Pet Shop Boys, and you have some insanely tasteful and listenable music throughout this gem.
