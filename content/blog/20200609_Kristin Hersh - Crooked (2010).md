### I could listen to Kristin Hersh play the bongos while reciting “The Lord’s Prayer”. It would still be mesmerising.   
  
To me, she has one of the best and most distinctive voices of all the rock ‘n’ roll women. It’s a real bonus that she’s also a pretty handy musician playing all of the instruments.   
This self-released record was entirely written, played and produced by herself.    
  
I remember buying her book “Crooked” with a download code for the digital album. That was the only way to get it. I therefore jumped at the chance of getting this great record on vinyl.   
  
While the hardback book is a thing of beauty, the music is now even more tangible.
