### Beautiful, ethereal music for a busy old back-at-work Wednesday. Just the ticket when you want some escape into the recesses of your own head space.
  
Tonight's choice is one of 9 LPs that make up a big box called "Music For Installations". This is one of the quieter pieces and reminds me a lot of some very early Tangerine Dream.

By the way, this monster box usually retails for around $400. In Wellington, I picked this up for $80. 

(I think someone had mispriced it as the CD box set price, which retails for around $99, the actual display ticket price on this box. Take another 20% off, which was the deal of the day, and you have a pretty good bargain).

One of my better moments as a vinyl trawling opportunist!
