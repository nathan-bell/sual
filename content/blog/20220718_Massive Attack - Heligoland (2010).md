### I'm not sure why this album gets such a bad rap. Ok, it's probably not The Massive at their peak of popularity but it certainly contains all of the elements that make it a sonically rich, refreshingly experimental and ultimately rewarding listen.

 For $3 at [Dixon's Recycled](http://www.dixons.com.au)  and a hole begging to be filled on my media wall, it was a no brainer. 

 The CD strikes back. And sounds fantastic through my cruddy old multi-format, disc player.
