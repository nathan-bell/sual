### Can't sing, can't play. Perfect.   
  
The Fair Brothers are from Uniontown in Maryland, USA. They formed Half Japanese in 1975.   
  
Jad Fair never tunes his guitar. He just plugs it in. He sings about giant crabs and Hammer Horror-style vampires. Brilliantly off kilter. Nathan may already love them!
