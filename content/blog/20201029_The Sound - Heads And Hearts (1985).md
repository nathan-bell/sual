### Not only an underrated band, THE MOST underrated band of all time!

 I've gone on about the poor hand "The Sound" were dealt on several occasions. I continue to affirm their greatness by re-listening to their wonderful catalogue.

 This was the first record of theirs I was exposed to and while not one of their masterpieces it's my favourite one.

 Great to pick up this 2020 pressing in Wellington recently. 

 RIP Adrian Borland (1957 - 1999)
