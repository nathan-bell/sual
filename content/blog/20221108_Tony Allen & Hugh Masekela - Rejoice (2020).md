### Now I remember why I still love vinyl! This remarkable recording featuring two African greats, drummer Tony Allen, and trumpet player Hugh Masekela, shouldn't exist in any other format.

 What you have here is the perfect package. The gatefold sleeve is superb, the liner notes comprehensively informative, but best of all, the music is simply stunning. 

 This is jazz my friends. The way it should be played - not the free form bollocks. My current wife will be tapping her toes to this.
