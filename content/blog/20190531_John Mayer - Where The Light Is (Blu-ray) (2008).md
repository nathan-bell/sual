### Got a bit of a haul from The Warehouse this evening.   
  
The Cure's "Pornography" & Che Fu's "Navigator" both on vinyl, The NZ polynesian/Maori music compilation "Heed The Call!" on CD and this dive into the largely unknown - John Mayer's 2008 concert in Los Angeles on Blu-ray. All for fuck all.

 My (very recent) belief is to give everyone a chance to prove themselves, even if that someone is deemed by many to be a complete tosser.

 I'd seen John Mayer on one of Eric Clapton's "Crossroads" compilations and always thought what a talented guitar player he was. This live concert recorded more than a decade ago certainly reinforces that. Some of his playing is astounding.   
  
It also reinforces the fact that he is a complete tosser.
