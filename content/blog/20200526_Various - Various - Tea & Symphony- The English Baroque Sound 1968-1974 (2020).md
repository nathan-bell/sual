### This is another impeccable and VERY English compilation from Mr. Bob Stanley and ACE Records. 

Originally released some 15 years ago, this is an updated version and covers English potty post-pyschedelic music from the late 60's to mid 70's. 

Fantastic in the arvo with a cuppa.  Like all ACE music compilations, it's a real treasure.
