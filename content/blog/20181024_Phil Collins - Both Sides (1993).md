### I'm far from being a musical snob, but I did try and hide Phil's face as I discreetly slid the monstrous double vinyl cover across the counter before parting with my $19.98. 

 "Go for the younger attendant" I thought to myself, they wouldn't know Phil from a bar of soap. (It is regretful that some people would openly proclaim that a bar of soap would be far more entertaining.)

 Anyway, I was once one of those people that would openly bag Phil. Not any more. Once you get over the shiny, crisp and sometimes tinny production, there's a good number of fantastic songs busting out of this mid-nineties gem.

 After hearing Lorde praise lyrical about Phil in a recent podcast with Marc Maron, I thought I'd further explore. She was right - get over yourself and listen without judgement. It might surprise you.
