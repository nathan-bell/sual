### I make no bones about it. Mick Ronson was/is the most important guitar player of my lifetime. It's a bold statement - but when you first encounter "Moonage Daydream" as a bare-arsed 12 year old, it counts for everything.  
  
That moment in time remains unmatched for shear audacity, tone and context. It was a guitar solo from the far reaches of outer space.

 This gem of a record, which I have only played fleetingly, is a real treasure and was made just before he died in 1993. Guests include Chrissie Hynde, Def Leppard vocalist Joe Elliott, John Mellencamp and David Jones
