 This is for me the best record of the late 70's early 80's.   
  
I know that's quite a big call but time and time again it continues to befuddle, bemuse and bewitch me. Despite having played this at least a couple of times a year for the last 3 or 4 decades, it's an album I have never tamed. It is certainly one that just keeps on giving.   
  
Although this is at times raw and menacing, it is incredibly sophisticated and funky. Barry Adamson on bass commandeers the powerhouse rhythm section. It also helps when you have musicians of similar calibre in John McGeogh, Dave Formula and front man Howard Devoto.     
  
Well and truly one of my desert Island discs.
