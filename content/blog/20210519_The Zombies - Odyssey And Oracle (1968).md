### Highly regarded as one of the treasures of the psychedelic 60s this is not really doing it for me at the moment. It sounds great, but doesn't grab me as an immediate classic.

 OK "Time Of The Season" sounds absolutely fantastic (it REALLY does!) but I probably need to invest in some more listening time to appreciate the rest.
