### I heard the last 15 minutes of Smithies on RNZ this afternoon. He was raving about this Swedish ensemble's first long player (or digital equivalent) "Off The Meds" by Off The Meds.

 This was only released in November 2020 so not a hope of getting it on any media anytime soon. Happy to stream this via Tidal this evening but will definitely be seeking this out. 

 This will have you dancing around the house but youâ€™ll still have your dignity in tact - it works on many levels. Cool-uncool!
