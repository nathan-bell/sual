### Holy Moly, I didn't expect this! It's the same old Alan Vega and his same old completely left of everything approach to making music - but god it sounds so frighteningly refreshing listening to this today.

 In this pre-millennium recording, he partners up with Stephen Lironi one time member of Altered Images - a band that couldn't be any further along on the other end of the musical spectrum than one Alan Vega.

 This is fantastic!
