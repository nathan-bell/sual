### I'm just about to dig into the book "Black Postcards: A Memoir" by Wellingtonian Dean Wareham, founder of Galaxie 500 and Luna.  
  
I recently discovered and purchased the three remastered/expanded Galaxy 500 records recorded prior to the band Luna and they are just so impressive. Why I didn't know about them previously, I can't fathom.

 While my introduction to Luna was 1995's Penthouse, which completely blew me away, this album recorded in 1994, is another gem of a record.Â   
  
Incidentally, Justin Hayward, previously of The Chills, was also a member of G500 and Luna.

 The last track on the album "Sleeping Pill" is mesmerising. Loving everything about these guys.
