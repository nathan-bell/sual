### This is probably my favourite album of the year so far. It's worth the price of admission alone just for the phenomenal band backing her.

 She's in great, restrained voice which lends itself to the reflective nature of her lyrics and the stunning but discreet musicianship throughout.

 One of my favorite tracks by another artist is "Wicked Game" by Chris Isaak. That "moody, quietly intense ballad full of heavy, shimmering atmospherics and smoky crooning" (I'm quoting here) is what this record delivers in spades. Â 

 Like Isaak's "Wild At Heart" soundtrack this deserves a long road trip.

 **2016 won't get much better than this!**
