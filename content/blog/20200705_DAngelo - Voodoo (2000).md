### The bottom end on this record is quite extraordinary. You do risk serious damage to your viscera and your speakers if you turn that knob too far.   
  
Along with that warning however is that the quality of production is second to none. It's a fabulous mix of R&B, jazz, soul and hip hop but there's also a hint of a more tasteful Prince (despite me never being a big fan), a full on evangelical Methodist choir and even some falsetto Maurice Gibb thrown into the mix.   
  
That clumsy attempt to define the indefinable really doesn't do it justice at all. It's really in a genre of it's own but you can comfortably put it in your "25 records you must listen to" list.
