### Picked up in London for about £2 or $3.80 in NZ currency. That's a lot of great music for less than a cup of coffee. And I tell you what - I'd love to have this as my cafe music when I'm consuming my flat white.

 What you do get is predictable. But that's a measure of quality more than complacency. He and his great band are in top form.

 A great post work blow out with The Don!
