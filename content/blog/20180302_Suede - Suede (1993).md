### It's goose bumps time again!  
  
One of the best British bands in recent history, lead singer Brett Anderson takes a big dollop of Bowie's glam and mixes it with Morrisey's glum. Astounding guitar playing and musicianship from Bernard Butler makes this record simply irresistible.  
  
There's not a weak song on the whole record, it's just wall to wall brilliance. 

 Four excellent solo albums, and two recent comeback records, without Bernard Butler, prove that Mr. Anderson is a proper songwriter.
