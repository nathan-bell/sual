### Two tracks in and I'm fucking putty!!!!

 "Crosseyed and Painless" is such a stunning track it leaves me catatonic and with goose bumps the size of blisters. In 5.1 surround it is simply jaw dropping.  
  
This record, released in 1980, comes a few months before David Byrne and Brian Eno released their astounding "My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts".  
  
After both of these records, my life would never be the same.

 Adrian Belew also goes berserk on this record.Â
