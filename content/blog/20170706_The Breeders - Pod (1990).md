### Insane cover, insanely good record! And all over in less than 30 minutes.  
I had the pleasure of seeing them support The Smashing Pumpkins in Wellington in 1994.

 The Breeders were absolutely brilliant and actually played their set twice - they all swapped instruments for the second time around.

 Kelly Deal is such a great song writer/vocalist. There's not a wasted sound on this masterpiece.Â
