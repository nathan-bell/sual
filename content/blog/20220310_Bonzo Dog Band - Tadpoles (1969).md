### A nice little, albeit dated, excursion tonight listening to some late 60's English Loonies. I spotted this 1986, nearly mint pressing, at a second hand record shop in Napier.

 Having heard the track "Shirt" at a recent "Shut Up and Listen" session recently, I thought it would be a good punt.

 While I'm a big Rutles fan, I do find it all a bit twee and corny. However, a lot of the music is toe-tappingly great. They were clearly exceptional musicians.

 Not really my cup of tea though.
