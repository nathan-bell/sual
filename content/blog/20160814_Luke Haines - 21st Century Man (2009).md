### More name-dropping madness from this eccentric Englishman (Crazy references to Peter Hammil, Klaus Kinski, David Bowie and Yasser Arafat amongst others).

 While lacking the brilliant, full-of-pop-hooks-songwriting from his days with The Auteurs and Black Box Recorder, it's still a fascinating listen. 

 While he's mellowed a bit with age, it's a sometimes biting commentary and Luke Haines seems to be well qualified to dish out this style of diatribe.
