### I've never really been a John Lennon fan. The purchase of this record and subsequent listening experience came about purely by chance.

 I never went out thinking "I need a John Lennon record". 

 When you see a pile of ridiculously under-priced "clearance" records sitting neglected in a bargain bin at the Warehouse in Richmond there is a tendency to feel sorry for a number of reasons:

1.  It's Richmond
2.  There will be no more long-playing vinyl records after this lot has gone. (even CDs and other media are disappearing from The Red Shed)
3.  No one in Richmond has any musical taste what so ever so why not give them a good home
4.  It's a no-brainer financially

 When getting around to actually listening to the 19 beautifully remastered tracks - they are all really rather special.
