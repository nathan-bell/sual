### I picked up a fantastic boxed, hard back book at TWH a year or so ago "The Beatles - The BBC Archives". It was a measly $10.

 A couple of months ago, two pristine 3LP sets arrived in the vinyl section - Vol 1 and Vol 2 of "Live At The BBC". They were far too expensive to even consider purchasing.

 During a recent sale, these plummeted in cost dramatically. For the cost of a few coffees and a scone or two, I am now the proud owner of 12 sides of Beatles BBC recordings in all of it's mono glory.

 Just the packaging alone is worth the asking price. It's pretty rough and raw in places but highly listenable. Knowing what they became makes it all the more fascinating.
