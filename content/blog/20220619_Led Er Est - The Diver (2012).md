### As it says on the cover “an LP recorded in 2011”

 There’s definitely a tip of the hat to 1980’s goth a La The Cure, Clan Of Xymox, Sisters Of Mercy etc. and it does feel comfortable to mine ears. Being brought up with everything 4AD also helps. 

 However, I’m afraid this all analogue dirge would not travel well for others looking for some sunshine amongst the seemingly endless winter dreariness.

 It’s a keeper for me.
