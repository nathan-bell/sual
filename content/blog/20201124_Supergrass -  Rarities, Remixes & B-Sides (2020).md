### This is another magnificent box set comprising of 6x LPs, 13 CDs, a 7' single, deluxe book, posters and other paraphernalia. This is Supergrass "The Strange Ones 1994 - 2008".

 While I'm not always a fan of the extras on special editions, this CD of rarities and non-album tracks from the box set, is on par with the rest of their studio records and far from just being filler.

 There's scorching versions of their own tracks and several great cover versions of other artists songs.
