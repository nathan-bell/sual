### This is one of the funkiest things you’ll ever hear. Miles’s short lived spouse and better half should have set the world alight with this, her stunning debut record. 

 The musicianship on this, obviously from a rich vein of hand picked Miles Davis session muscians, is truly remarkable. 

 All 3 of her 1970’s records are sensational but unfortunately the world wasn’t ready.  
I listened to her 2nd record “They Say I’m Different” [a few days after she passed away.](http://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2022/2/16/betty-davis-they-say-im-different-1973)
