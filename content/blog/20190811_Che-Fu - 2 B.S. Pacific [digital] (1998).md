### "Chains" is right up there on top of my favourite Kiwi songs list. Thankfully, this debut record by Post-Supergroove funk-rocker turned Hip-Hop Maestro Che-Fu is of equal quality throughout.

 What's really refreshing is it hasn't used the American Gangsta template but remains uniquely Pacific.
