### Thanks Nick, you bought this great slab of vinyl along to Tuesday's Shut Up And Listen session and the ear worm hasn't left since!

 By far the best track of the night, "Maybe I'll see you in my dreams", I think it took us all by surprise. 

 I ventured down to "The Family Jewels" to see if I could order a copy and right there in the bin of new arrivals was a newly minted vinyl copy.

 My first "proper" listen, (I have listened to it a couple of times via Tidal), it's continues to fully infiltrate my "this sounds fucking brilliant" nodes.
