### This is in my top 10 records. This is not one of those records that was a right of passage or a sign post or fork in the road on my musical journey. Just a fucking amazing record - start to finish. 

Every one of the 19 songs (it's a big, mother fucking double!) is top shelf. Not a note wasted for all of it's 60 odd minutes. Soon to purchased on new vinyl - it's a complete stunner!
