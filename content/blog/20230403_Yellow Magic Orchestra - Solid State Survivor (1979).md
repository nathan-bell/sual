### RIP: The Great Ryuici Sakamoto, founding member of YMO, actor, record producer and composer/muscian, died after a long illness on March 28th. 

 His song “Forbidden Colours”, a collaboration with David Sylvian, remains one of my absolute favourite bits of music. 

 This very early work with electronic pioneers YMO is an example of his brilliance and innovation.
