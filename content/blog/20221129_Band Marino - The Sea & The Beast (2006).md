### It's $32 Tuesday. Time to rip open another CD from The Red Cross Collection.

 I started out with Dum Dum Girls 2011 album, "Only In Dreams", but gave up after a few tracks. While not .... hideous, it quickly gave me little confidence that things would improve.

 Now this is way better. An ecletic mix of punk-folk, rock and banjo that fills up the speakers very nicely indeed. The real instrument, however, is the wonderful lead vocals of Nathan Bond.

 It's a shame they only made one record. This is definitely a keeper.
