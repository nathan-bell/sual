### Had an absolute field day today at the Big Red Shed. (coincidentally, on the Sabbath day!!)

 Bought the big 8-sides-of-vinyl box set AND the new CD/DVD/Vinyl deluxe box set of their latest album "13" for sod all. Â I've been waiting for this day, sneakily keeping an eye on the Warehouse's not-so-regular vinyl reductions and waiting to pounce. Today was that day.

 It's essential to have at least a couple of Ozzy-era Sabbath records on vinyl. I don't, so this amazing collection, covering 1970 to 1978, and including 31 tracks, just about covers all bases.
