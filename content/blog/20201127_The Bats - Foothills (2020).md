### This new record by The Bats is like a big warm sneaky hug. As each song meanders along on it's lackadaisical way, it's easy to think "what's happening here?".

 Without exception, each and every track richly rewards with some sublime hooks and beautiful ever-so-slightly-behind-the-singer instrumentation. 

 If you slowed the Stones right down, they'd have a similar meter to this. I had some initial hesitation about purchasing this - but I neednâ€™t have bothered - this is just fabulous.
