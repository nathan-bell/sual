### I just loved Dan Snaith’s (Caribou’s sole band member) 2014 record “Our Love” so I couldn’t resist picking up this 2021 repress from a decade earlier.

 It’s a really interesting mix of Beck, Flaming Lips and Yo La Tengo even. But most importantly it’s a very unique sound to call his own.

 Worth a few plays to bed it in - there’s just so much going on.
