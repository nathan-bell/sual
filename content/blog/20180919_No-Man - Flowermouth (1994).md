### Yet another piece of the musical heritage puzzle that is the Steven Wilson brand. This early 90's record is a largely experimental, but highly accessible pop record made in collaboration with vocalist Tim Bowness.

 Along with recording and touring with Porcupine Tree, Blackfield, Bass Communion and Storm Corrosion, producing the odd Opeth record, and juggling duties as a Grammy nominated remaster-master of too many artists to mention, he actually has time to create a dozen superb records with No-Man. 

 Despite saying I'm only playing Steven Wilson-related records this month, it certainly doesn't feel like it. There's an endless supply of brilliantly crafted, executed and produced material to last 12 months. I'm not joking either!
