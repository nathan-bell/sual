### An Organ Grindin' Funky Good Time soundtrack from 1969's "Party Girls" a long lost (probably for the best) low budget sleaze fest.

 While the music does over stay its formulaic welcome somewhat it's still a funky, finger snapping, jazzy affair.

 Not essential by any means but an interesting and entertaining curio of the time.
