### I recently spotted a reference to Group 1850 in a recent "Shindig!" magazine.   
  
[By the way Shindig! is now on [Readly](https://nz.readly.com/), an incredibly cheap and efficient way of getting access to ALL of your favourite magazines digitally. It's really the Netflix of digital magazines.]

 Anyway, Group 1850 was a psych/garage band formed in The Netherlands in 1964. While not deemed much to write home about at the time, it is only in the last few years that they are deemed to be significant. On the very first listen, I can understand why.   
  
A fantastic find and now firmly on my deep dive list.
