### I can't imagine Trump knowing what music is yet alone having a favourites playlist.

 If for some reason he did have a slither of musical cognisance the soundtrack of his life over over the last 5 years would be "Send Out The Clowns" on continuous play.

 Now Barack Obama is another matter. His curated list on Tidal is coolness personified.
