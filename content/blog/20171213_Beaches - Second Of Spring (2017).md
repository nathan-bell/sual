Just jumped off the plane from Melbourne (via a Wellington stop over) and brought this double slab of Aussie vinyl back with me.

I first heard this mesmerising, psychedelic wig-out while browsing in the wonderful "Polyester Records" on Brunswick Street.

I knew nothing about this all female quintet and proceeded to feed my iPhone with a Tidal feed of the record over the next few days. All I can say is, it's a fucking ripper and a great, permanent memento of a fabulous 10 days in Melbourne. Currently on high rotation.
