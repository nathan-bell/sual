### I heard a great interview on Radio New Zealand this morning with songwriter, producer and documentary maker Mark Tierney. 

 He was responsible for the wonderful Strawpeople. The programme certainly re-kindled my fond memories of this great album.

 What was amazing was that the Bristol sounds of Massive Attack’s “Blue Lines” in the early 1990’s coexisted with Strawpeople's earliest recordings. Portishead was still a few years away.

 Hugely pioneering this album still sounds contemporary and essential. "Trick With A Knife" is the real stunner!
