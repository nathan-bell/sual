### While the Aussies continue to under-perform in the sporting arena, those playing for the psychedelic dream pop team are scoring a lot of points on the ear candy ledger.

 I've just spent a great week in Melbourne where I've been exposed to quite a bit of contemporary, state-of-the-art Aussie pop. While not necessarily original or pioneering, they craft some brilliantly catchy songs that sound uniquely ....well.... Australian.

 Despite the syrup, there's often a rough edge to proceedings.
