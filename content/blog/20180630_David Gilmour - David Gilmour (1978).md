### This record is more often than not completely rubbished by the music critics. This debut by the ex, and once second-in-charge Floydian, is full of trademark Gilmour and recalls great memories of me playing this with great regularity.  
  
This was recorded around the time of Floyd's most difficult record, and possibly my favourite record of theirs, "Animals". This is light relief from that dystopian nightmare.  
  
His tone and the punctiliousness of his playing is not duplicated by any other guitar player. He rarely deviates from the expected template and this is true of this album.  
  
I'm more than happy to be still listening to "dad rock" if it sounds as good as this.
