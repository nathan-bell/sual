### Some of my very best purchases I've ever made are sometimes found in the new vinyl, bargain bins of the big mega music shops like JB-Hifi and Real Groovy. 

 The relatively newly pressed vinyl that's in those bins are usually unloved and unsold. This does not mean however that they aren't any good and this gem from 1970 confirms this.

 This is a fabulous compilation of some of Love's greatest tracks from 1966 through to 1970. On Red vinyl, this gate-folded, beautifully pressed record cost me $18.

 A brilliant buy!
