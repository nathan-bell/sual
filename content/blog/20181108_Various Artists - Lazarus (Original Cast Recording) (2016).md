### Great reinterpretation of Bowie songs by the original cast members of "Lazarus" - a stage show commissioned by Mr. Jones himself just prior to his death in 2016.

 Some of the songs are a real revelation given their theatrical treatment. I've been mostly put off with most Bowie covers in the past but this is something a bit special. 

 Not bad for a $4.98 outlay.
