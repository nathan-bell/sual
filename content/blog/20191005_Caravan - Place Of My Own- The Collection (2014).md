### A great place to start if you are completely new to Caravan(ing).

Spanning the late 60's, early 70's, it's got such a fantastic folky, psychedelic vibe that leans somewhat towards a progressive rock sound.

It's a much lighter trip than early Genesis but certainly highlights many English eccentricities. 

Dave Sinclair's organ playing is superb throughout and Pye Hastings does a wicked impersonation of a friendly gorilla and apparently uses quite an assortment of ashtrays. 

Loving it!
