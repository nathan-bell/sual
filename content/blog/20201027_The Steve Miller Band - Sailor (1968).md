### I found this at The Warehouse in Whanganui on shiny new bright blue vinyl.   
  
This is a recent re-pressing/remaster (2018) and cost me $20. (I did try to haggle you know!)

 Unfortunately this was the only early album among his more mainstream records that were for sale. 

 This was the swan song for Boz Scaggs who lends his wonderful vocals on a couple of blues-infused tracks to end the album.
