### Picked this up for a bargain at the great TWH sale. (Incidently, where else in Nelson can you actually buy vinyl?)

 I would definitely have paid full price for this though. Thanks Chris for the track "Poppa Cool Bell" at the last Shut Up And Listen session.

 The album, while trade mark PS, it's full of great variety and as always with Mr. Simon - brilliant instrumentation and production.

 Old gits making great records seems to be a trend lately - some dead, some otherwise. This is up there with the best.
