### Today is John Lydon's birthday. Being empowered with this knowledge, I immediately reached for my collection of PiL (Public Image Limited) records, Lydon's post Pistols collective.

 Now this is HEAVY - as in heavy metal(ish). He's got a pretty eclectic bunch of musicians on this one including Steve Vai, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Ginger Baker. Â 

 The remastered 5 album set I finally managed to pick up in Melbourne (I'd been scouring the planet prior) sounds amazing. This is great listening. Happy Birthday My Lydon you clever bastard!
