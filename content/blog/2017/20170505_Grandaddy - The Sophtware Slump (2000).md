### What do you play on the day of the birth of your first grand child? (Hello Emma). It's simply a no-brainer!

 One of my desert island discs if ever there was one is this gem from 2000. The first track alone "He's simple, he's dumb, he's the pilot" is my sweet spot. "Miner at Dial-A-View" comes a close second. 

 2000 was also the year my wife Sarah's dad and the kids' Grandpa passed away.

 Kevin Garcia, the 41 year old co-founder and bassist of Grandaddy, died this very week as well.

 So you see this record, as well as being a fucking stunner, is symbolic in so many ways. 

 But for god sake don't call me "Grandaddy"
