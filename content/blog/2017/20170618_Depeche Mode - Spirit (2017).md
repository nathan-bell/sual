### I've been listening this for a few months now via Tidal and on the strength of repeated listens I needed to own the plastic,  
  
Their best record since Violator it's also their bit "Fuck America!" post-Election, anti-Trump, anti-corporation record. And it's good - Very good!

 I haven't heard a more powerful record this year, production-wise and message-wise, than this. There's still life in the old gits!
