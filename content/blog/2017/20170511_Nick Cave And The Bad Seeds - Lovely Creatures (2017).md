### Grinderman at the Coronet, Elephant And Castle, London on October 2nd 2010 was undoubtedly the loudest and most organ eviscerating gig I've ever experienced.

 I started at front of stage hugging the speakers but when things kicked off I was completely fucked. Had the biggest panic attack amidst an unforgiving audience who just wanted to squash up closer to King Nick and crazy man Warren Ellis. I eventually got back and witnessed a stunning gig but the shock and awe of those first moments will never leave me. Nick Cave was just mesmerising, (read frightening) like some fucking messiah.

 This triple vinyl stunner is a compilation of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds tracks covering a period of 30 years from 1984 to 2014. Sounding just brilliant on vinyl. Â
