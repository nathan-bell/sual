### I haven't spent a lot of time with this one, (I picked it up for $1.67 a few weeks back), but what I do hear is not what I expected. And that's a great thing.

 Don't get me wrong, I love the blues, but I'm a little bit over it these days. I've done Rory, Gary (Moore) and Johnny and other more recent blues revivalists to death.

 There is some blues in there but there's also a great mix of R&B, Soul, Rock'n'Roll and gospel. He's obviously a great guitar player but definitely doesn't overstay his welcome.
