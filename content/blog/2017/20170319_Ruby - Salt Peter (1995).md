### Stunning debut from Ruby aka Leslie Rankine. Released more that 20 years ago, this is Nine Inch Nails meets Portishead. Not always easy listening Not always easy listening but invigorating to say the least.

 While this was her only release, (as I thought anyway) up until a couple of years ago, there was also a brilliant but very hard to find, remixed version. I've been hunting that down for years.

 I'm pleased to discover that she released a new album in 2014 available on Tidal. I'll be listening to that over the next couple of weeks.

 **Best Track: Tiny Meat**.
