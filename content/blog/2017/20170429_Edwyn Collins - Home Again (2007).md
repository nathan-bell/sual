### **Live:    Edwyn Collins - Thursday 23/09/2010 - Queen Elizabeth Hall, London**

 This was one of the most emotional and poignant gigs I've ever been to.

 I'd just finished reading "Falling & Laughing: The Restoration Of Edwyn Collins" written by his wife Grace Maxwell. The once front man of Orange Juice and solo artist ("A Girl Like You") had two devastating cerebral hemorrhages in 2005 and this book documented his battles with survival and his eventual return to performance. 

 The concert on the South Bank, showcased his new album, "Losing Sleep" the first written since his recovery. Fortunately, this happened to coincide with a trip to London in 2010.

 He arrived on stage (after an exceptionally great set by support band The Kinbeats) shuffling along with two big canes, actively refusing any help, to a standing ovation and thunderous applause. He wasn't here for any sympathy however and proceeded to put on a fabulous show like nothing happened. Inspirational. 

 The highlight was an extended version of "A Girl Like You" with a squalling, feed-back infused guitar solo courtesy of Little Barrie‘s Barrie Cadogan that just wouldn't end. No one wanted it to. Paul Cook (Once Sex Pistol) kept the beat. Fucking brilliant!
