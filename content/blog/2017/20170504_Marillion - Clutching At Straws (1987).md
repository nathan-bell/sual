### Not so long ago, I wouldn't have touched this sort of stuff with a barge pole. It's only recently that I've delved into English rock pomposity in the interests of expanding my musical horizons. 

 Marillion have been a leading "Progressive Rock" band in Britain for a few decades now but do have a tendency to reinvent their sound for each subsequent record. 

 This, their last record with lead singer "Fish", is great. I picked this up along with 5 or 6 of their other records on vinyl for around $15 a piece and have nothing but admiration for their invention and superb musicianship. The gatefold covers are shit hot as well.

 OK, I wouldn't be seen dead in a Marillion T-Shirt but I'm not precious about exploring all musical genres these days - it's still full of great surprises 

 The guitar solo on the last track "The Last Straw" is brilliant.
