### Another $5 bargain bin escapee.

 I've always been curious about this one but never bothered pursuing. Beautifully packaged, I couldn't lose! If it was shite, it would still look pretty!

 After the initial shock and check that it was playing at the right speed, I realised that it really was the dudes voice not vinyl playing at 45 rpm.  You quickly get used to it and realise what a gifted singer/songwriter Mike Rosenberg is.

 Melodic and lyrical, I'd rather listen to this dude any day rather than fucking Mumford and Sons or Ed Sheeran. He's just a bit more twee, less popular and more personal.
