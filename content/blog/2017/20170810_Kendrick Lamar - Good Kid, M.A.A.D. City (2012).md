### Kendrick Lamar is such a great story teller that you sometimes forget what an absolute brilliant producer, musician and collaborator he is.

 It's so invigourating to hear such intelligent music that is both challenging and unbelivably entertaining. 

 This was my first KL record and as with all of his subsequent records he never fails to deliver the lastest and greatest best record of the year.
