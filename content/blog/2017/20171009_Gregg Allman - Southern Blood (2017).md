### [As previously proclaimed](http://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2017/5/30/greg-allman-laidback-1973), Gregg Allman's "Laidback" is one of my most treasured records. 

 This beautiful posthumous vinyl recording is another wonderful gift that will be equally cherished.

 The first track "My Only True Friend" just speaks volumes.  I'll let Gregg do the talking.

 "You and I both know, this river will surely flow to an end/Keep me in your heart...I hope you're haunted by the music of my soul.."
