### OK, I raved about this stunning box set that I practically stole from TWH back in July last year.

 (incidentally I've seen it retailing for $299 US on some websites!!!)

 I didn't realise at the time but there's a couple of rip-snorting tracks by NZ's very own Ticket - "Awake" and "Dream Chant" from their "Awake" album. I was so overwhelmed by the entire soundtrack I didn't bother name checking.

 This remains my best find EVER! No contest!
