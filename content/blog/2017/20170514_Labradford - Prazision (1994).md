### This was another reference in a recent podcast - in this case the focus was on ["Post Rock"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-rock) music.

 I've always loved ambient-infused rock music that strips any "n'roll" out of the mix.

 Along with Slint, The For Carnation, Mogwai and NZ's very own Jakob, Labradford's output is stark and repetitive, and demands some serious investment in repeated listens.

 This particular record is quite possibly an uncomfortable listen for many and not something they would necessarily "get". That suits me perfectly.
