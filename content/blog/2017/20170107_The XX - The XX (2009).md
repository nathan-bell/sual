### The song "Heart Skipped A Beat" completely does my head in! This is the entire The Cure's "Seventeen Seconds" wrapped up in one song. It's one of the few goose bump inspiring moments I've got left in this world.

 However, that's quickly erased by the baddest and biggest bottom end ever heard by the naked ear. 

 Most definitely in my top 390 records of all time!!
