### Aside from John Grant, try and find a more pure voice in rock than Jim James. As with John Grant's band, the Czars, it's really all about the front guy. While MMJ is a great, great band, the true inspiration and catalyst for this astonishing record is Jim James. 

 He's gone on and worked with many others in all sorts of genres - The Roots, M.Ward, Bright Eyes, T.Bone Burnett, Monsters Of Folk and The Decemberists to name just a few. In every case, he has the midas touch.

 I was working through a collection of "acquired" videos a few days back and came across a remarkable live performance (in glorious DTS surround) by Jim James and Tom Morello playing ["The Ghost Of Tom Joad" at the MusiCares Person Of The Year 2013 tribute to Bruce Springsteen](https://vimeo.com/151016562).

 What an absolute stonker of a song and guitar solo with The Boss watching, with great admiration, from the audience. In the case it was Tom Morello who stole the show.
