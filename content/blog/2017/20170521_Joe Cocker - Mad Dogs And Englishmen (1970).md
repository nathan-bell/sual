### I've just arrived back from Wellington where we spent a few days and whilst there, I came across this double vinyl remnant from my early years. (Cost me a measly $19.99 from JB-Hifi)

 This was another big Sister artifact that I remember listening to constantly, along with the "Easy Rider" Soundtrack,  back in the early '70s.

 Listening to this again for the first time in probably 40 years, it's a wonderful big band extravaganza with Joe Cocker in truly sensational form.

 While I've never been a great Joe Cocker fan this is something else. Having Leon Russell tinkering away on piano doesn't hurt and the shear size of the ensemble, makes it a special treat.
