### This record renders me catatonic. It demands my attention.

 I close my eyes and can't concentrate on anything else. It's impossible to focus on anything when this beast is playing.

 It's richness is embarrassing. It's production impossible. Lyrically it's incendiary.

 It's a friggin' miracle!
