### A package arrived at work on Thursday. This was sent via courier from Wellington after journeying as hand luggage all the way from London courtesy of my Son in Law Matt.

 A crowd gathered. They were fascinated by the actuality of music carrying media. Among the kitty was this lovely, and very recently discovered, double vinyl record from Mount Kimbie. 

 Mount Kimbie (basically two dudes from London) use analogue instruments to make glorious "post-dubstep" grooves. Whatever that means it's fucking brilliant. 

 A couple of observers later "spotified" Mount Kimbie. They weren't impressed. I now love it all the more!!
