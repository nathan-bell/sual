### What a load of bollocks to suggest Steven Wilson has sold out. Giving up his more "progressive" attributes to go all "pop" on this, his latest offering. Bring back Porcupine Tree they shout. Hey, Steven Wilson was ALWAYS Porcupine Tree with some really good musicians surrounding him.  

 OK, this has gone more mainstream but it's only the fact he's gone to a more marketable label and finally getting the recognition he rightly deserves. The music is still very much Steven Wilson's vision and execution,  and it's of such consistently fabulous quality it's no big deal.

 Picked this up via my UK mule recently. Just waiting for my double vinyl to arrive.
