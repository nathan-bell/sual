### This gem is definitely one of my desert island discs.

 Without a doubt this masterpiece holds so much significance in my musical journey. Another gift from my big sister. I first heard "Laidback" in my early teens and it's a record I have never tired of. It's also an album you simply must play in it's entirety - it's impossible not to. 

 I haven't managed to track down a copy on vinyl yet but it's most certainly on the top of my list. 

 What makes it all the more meaningful this evening is the news just learnt, that Gregg Allman has died. Another true legend gone.
