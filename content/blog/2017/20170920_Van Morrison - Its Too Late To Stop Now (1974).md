### For such a grumpy bastard, it's surprising that Van Morrison oozes so much soul and humanity. Reality, apparently, is very different. He just shuns the attention.

 From a recent article in the Irish Times:

 You don’t have to spend long with Van Morrison to realise that his relationship with fame is one of deep, honest and implacable hatred. He experiences it neither as an addictive high nor as an inconvenience that comes with his territory but as a kind of punishment, the world’s revenge for all those moments of ecstasy and exhilaration he has achieved in his art. 

 This brilliant live recording from 1973 is stunning. An astounding vocal performance and brilliant musicianship adds up to something truly special.
