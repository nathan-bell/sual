### I dropped the needle on this big slap of recently remastered ruby red vinyl and gasped in stunned disbeleif. If there's ever an argument in favour of vinyl over digital - this just has to be it.Â This freshly re-minted record just sounds so good. I'm not sure what it is but it just does. Now that's a great argument isn't it!?

 I'm not sure where 10CC fits into my musical world but this record, their debut, is worth owning just for the track "Donna". A doo wop classic. "Rubber Bullets" isn't half bad either.
