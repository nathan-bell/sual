### I'm not sure why these dudes get compared to Sonic Youth?

 I'm a big fan of Thurston, Kim and the boys and really struggle with that concept. 

 OK, they also tune their instruments a bit funny, but to me, they sound more like Blonde Redhead than Sonic Youth. 

 This brilliant record is a stunner. It's a mess of melody, intensity and vocals that have little resemblance to any conventional language. Genius.
