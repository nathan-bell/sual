### This just sounds majestic on my turntable. This is another example of a record best experienced on vinyl - spread over 4 sides, there's plenty of breathing space in those grooves.

 His post Whiskeytown debut is just choker full of brilliant songs. It doesn't hurt having Gillian Welch and David Rawlings backing him either.

 An embarrassment of riches.
