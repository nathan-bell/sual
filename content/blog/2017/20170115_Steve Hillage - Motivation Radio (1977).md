### Fucking hell, what a mixed up old time this was! In the midst of a punk maelstorm, this proggy, hippy, trippy masterpeice comes out of nowhere and completely changes everything.

 In my top 10 records of all time, this remastered version has never sounded so essential.

 Hillage is a guitar genius that bypassed the mainstream completely. This record is absolutely bonkers but something I call "my own".
