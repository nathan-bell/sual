### It's funny how things can become more acceptable over time. OK, I'll concede that corduroy pants and feral cardigans will never be acceptable. In any context.

 Phil Collins was once the king of uncool. You would never risk getting caught with one of his records in your collection or found NOT skipping his section in the record bins.

 Well I've got news for you, his debut record, which I recently re-purchased on vinyl, is one of the coolest things I've ever heard! And many, many people would now agree with me. Prove me wrong and I'll eat my corduroys.
