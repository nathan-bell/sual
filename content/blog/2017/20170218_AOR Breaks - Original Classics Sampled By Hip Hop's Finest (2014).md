### $9.98 at TWH buys you a double recording on beautiful blue vinyl featuring 16 reasonably blissful and VERY adult oriented rock tracks from 16 different artists.

 As varied as Steve Miller, Steve Reich and The Grateful Dead this sounds like a great mix tape to me!! And I'm loving it. My second blue vinyl LP in a row.
Life is good!!
