### A far cry from Friday's everything-bar-the-kitchen-sink early 70's psycho-soup, this is sparse and demanding of concentration.

 These are the records I really treasure the most. It's not an immediate payload, the beauty and subtlety unlikely to fully unfold until after the third or forth listen.

 On four sides of vinyl, it is magnificent in it's orchestral/vocal splendor and the soundscape is massive. It just needs time to breathe.
