### Still enigmatic after all of these years, 23 of them at last count, I will never do it any justice by talking about it. 

 The nearest representative "thing" that comes close is Talk Talk's "Spirit Of Eden". Even that's clutching at straws. It's totally beyond category. 

 This 2017 remaster is even more immersive. Grab a chair, close your eyes and don't move for all of it's 50 odd minutes - just listen.  It's a piece of music you must hear at least once in your lifetime.
