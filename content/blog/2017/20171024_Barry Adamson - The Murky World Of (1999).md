### Prior to his solo career which kicked off in the late 80's, he was bass player extraordinaire for Magazine (A definite desert Island band) and Nick Cave's Bad Seeds (no slouches either!)Â 

 This is cinematic/film noir music for imaginary films. This brilliant compilation includes stuff from his pre-millennial albums.

 It's suffocating stuff - slightly sinister where you can feel the sleaze, taste the whiskey and gag on the smoke. I need a bath.
