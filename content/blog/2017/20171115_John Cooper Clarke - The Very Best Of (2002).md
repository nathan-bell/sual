### Cracking retrospective of the legendary punk poet John Cooper Clarke.

 His is a name that's cropped up many times over the years but he was not really appreciated until well into his 60's.  Mind you, when you're a heroin addict and hooked up with Femme Fatale Nico, self preservation rather than self promotion predominates.

 This 20 track compilation is a great introduction to his unique and vitriolic brand of poetry.

 The music that supports his monotonous delivery (actual singing would be a travesty!) works brilliantly.

 He's "playing" in a few main centres around New Zealand in April next year.
