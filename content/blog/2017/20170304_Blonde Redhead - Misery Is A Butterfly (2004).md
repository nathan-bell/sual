### This band never ceases to amaze me. I'm trawling through their entire back catalogue (going back to the mid-90s) where they were first discovered and nurtured by Sonic Youth's Steve Shelley.

 This album is where I first encountered this wonderful band and it remains my most played and essential Blonde Redhead record. As I say I'm working through all of their other recordings and loving every minute.

 I was fortunate to see them at the wonderful Islington Town Hall, in Highbury, London, in 2014. It was an absolute stonker of a show.
