### Endless in name, endless in execution. With most songs lasting around the 8 to 10 minute mark it's an epic non-stop jam session and an exercise in endurance.

 The "vocalist" is some sort of scat caveman. There's absolutely nothing intelligible "sung" other than grunts, snorts and groans and the odd monosyllable utterance here and there.Â 

 The big, bluesy, stoner guitars follow the 12 bars blues template but are embellished with a multitude of tones and classic sounds. The wah wah peddle gets a real workout.

 Rough as guts but never tiresome. Great mid-week musical fodder.
