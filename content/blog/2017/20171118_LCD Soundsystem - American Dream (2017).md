### This record was very recently voted "Record of the Year" 2017 by Uncut Magazine. Up until today, I did not own this record. Up until today, I had not heard this record. 

 I saw LCD Soundsystem perform at the Big Day Out in 2008. They were absolutely stunning.  
  
In 2011, they officially broke up among-st much fan fare. The wonderful film "Shut Up And Play The Hits" documents this event.

 5 years later they re-formed and made this record. I have just listened to it. It is good. VERY good!
