### This record is just an embarrassment of riches. I really had forgotten just how brilliant this album is. Â Not a wasted note from start to finish and at over 70 minutes in length, that's a big ask.

 This is soon to be remastered on vinyl by the remix genius Steven Wilson - I won't hesitate in adding this to my "must have on vinyl" collection.
