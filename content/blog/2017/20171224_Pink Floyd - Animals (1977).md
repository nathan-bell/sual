### 2017. What a fucking pig's breakfast of a year. It's been great in so many ways personally, a new Grandchild, a Wedding in Australia and we're not bankrupt.

 While here in New Zealand we might be turning the corner and moving away from our own brutal, National-led, dog-eat-dog, piss-on-the-poor-and-middle-classes legacy, the rest of the world is completely fucked!Â 

 This record, written by a very miserable Roger Waters in 1977, just about nails the current bleakness of world politics.

 *You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to,So that when they turn their backs on you,You'll get the chance to put the knife in.*

 There's no getting away from it. Trump's a complete cunt!!
