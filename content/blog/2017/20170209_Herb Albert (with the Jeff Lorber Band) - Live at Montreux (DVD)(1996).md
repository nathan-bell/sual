### My mother used to play Herb Albert and The Tijuana Brass. He was the king of easy listening jazz and I remember some great tunes. "Spanish Flea" anyone? Put it this way - it didn't do me any harm but it was pretty lame.

 This 1996 performance is a very different Herb Alpert indeed. This is funky, more contemporary and is a proper band - not wall to wall syrup. With a fantastic band in support you really get to hear what a great musician he is.
