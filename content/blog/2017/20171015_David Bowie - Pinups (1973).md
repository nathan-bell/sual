### It's a strange one this one. While rubbished by many, Bowie purists and otherwise, this is quite possibly my second favourite Bowie record (my actual favourite Bowie record seems to be one of many!?)

 A slight, light relief from the stark, slightly off-kilter "Aladdin Sane", this just rocked. It was also the last record with Mick Ronson. I love the riffs and Bowie's free license to embellish, reinterpret and chchchchchchange things up completely.

 The album cover with himself and "Twig the WonderKid" is also one of my favourites.Â
