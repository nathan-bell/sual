### **Live:    Jeff Beck - Tuesday 3/02/2009 - ASB Theatre, Auckland**

 Without a doubt the greatest musician (and quite possibly the most talented bunch of supporting musicians) I've ever witnessed and at one of NZ's premier music venues.

 Without any banter throughout, aside from introducing the band and saying farewell at the end, shy old Jeff, Vinnie Colaiuta, Tal Wilkenfeld and David Sancious just went about their business. What an absolutely astounding band!

 While technically at the pinnacle of ability and execution, this was no perfunctory gig, the performance just oozed soul. When he played "Where Were You" my brain went to complete mush. What a fucking genius!!! 

 A life long dream realised - Jeff Beck in the flesh.
