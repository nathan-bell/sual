 A band that certainly jumped on the punk/new wave band wagon back in the late 70's.  The difference was, they had fucking great songs. This album was played to death and is still a record that brings back a lot of fond memories.

 I remember seeing them, along with The Knobz, at the Maroubra Seals Club in Sydney in 1980. They were brilliant. However, my new girlfriend, and first wife Sarah, did spend a bit of time throwing up in the stair well. The smoky atmosphere and incredible volume was pretty intense to say the least. I also worked with Kevin Stanton's Mum at Kimberley Hospital. She was, and deserved to be, immensely proud. 

 One of my fondest memories was Mi-sex being referenced in the once great "Heavy Metal" fantasy magazine. I recently found a copy on line.
