### Bought this chunk of vinyl from Grant Smithies new "Family Jewels" record shop this very day.

 Hopefully, this record shop will fill the big void for us Nelsonians wanting a decent vinyl supply. (You can only tolerate so much Warehouse trawling!!)

 I actually dreamed of finding this particular record on the shelf the night before I visited for the first time. I practically walked straight to it. Weird eh?

 The opening track "Maggot Brain" is worth the price alone. While it will need a few listens - it now rightly sits in my collection.
