### This record, along with Zoot Allures, is my favourite Zappa album.

 While I'm not overly familiar with much Zappa, (I'm not a clinically obsessive fanatic), I just know what I like.Â I wish I understood - but for me it all comes down to the music. This is just chocker block full of it.

 More talent in his little pinky ... (now that's another story!).Full stop.
