### An interesting collaboration between Steven Wilson and lead Opeth(ian) Mikael Ã…kerfeldt.

 Far removed from Swedish Death Metal and more like a pastoral electronic folk session with occasional riffage.

 It's brilliant late evening listening and quite meditative. A big disappointment for the hardened metal head but bliss for those with a more liberated musical palate.
