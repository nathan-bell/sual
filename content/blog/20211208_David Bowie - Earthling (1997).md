### The stunning sonics of this newly pressed vinyl box continues. It's certainly a box of goodies that just keeps giving.

 This is another record which I've only listened to in parts ("Little Wonder" & "I'm afraid Of Americans") and most probably not in its entirety in one sitting.

 Trashed by the naysayers and I probably paid far too much attention.

 Very much of its time, Industrial/Drum & Bass sounds predominate, but it still sounds powerful and hooky as a good Bowie record should.
