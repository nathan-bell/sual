### There's not a lot of information out there about one Emerson Sandidge.   
  
He was born into a musical family in Gary, Indiana.  His mother was a relative of jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald and his father and older brother were proficient guitarists.   This recording sounds wonderfully familiar and comfortable  but underlying it are some worrisome lyrics suggesting not is all well with Emerson's world view. 

 It's all over in just 34 minutes and does leave you wanting more.
