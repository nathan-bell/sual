### I watched the first episode of the latest Twin Peaks "Limited Event Series" last night. OMG! It is way, way beyond what I expected. Possibly the most challenging and enjoyable 60 minutes of television I've experienced this year.

 Just putting aside the tension and drama that unfolds, the music has always been one of the strong points of the show. This continues strongly for the new season. I'll be searching that soundtrack out soon.

 This soundtrack I'm listening to today is from the original series and has lost nothing since I first heard it 25 plus years ago.
