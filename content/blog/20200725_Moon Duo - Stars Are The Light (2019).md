### Allmusic.com, and their  “know it all, yes we do have the final say on the matter” approach  to music reviews is wearing thin.   
  
That site used to be my go to place for a quick, help-me-out-here lookup when choosing music to listen to or potentially purchase. Their review of this record was so far off the mark, and scathing, I nearly didn’t give it any time of day.   
  
I’m glad I did, it’s one of my finds of the year.
