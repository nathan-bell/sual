### Holy Moley where do you start with this?! 

 While hailed as one of the most important rock recordings of all time when they delivered their revered "OK Computer", Radiohead went even more left field with these evil twins.

 Kid A was an incredible, brazenly so, breach of expectation. Nary a guitar in sight, this was glitchy, twitchy electronic gloopy nonsense. 

 Less than a year later they produced Amnesiac, an album that was largely recorded at the same time as Kid A. The same but different.

 While not always an easy listen, it's a remarkable one. While they may have borrowed from other sonic pioneers, no one sounds like Radiohead.
