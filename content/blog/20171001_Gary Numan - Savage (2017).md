### I was a huge Gazza fan back in 1979 when Tubeway Army gave us "Are Friends Electric" on the "Replicas" album. Then came the phenomenal "The Pleasure Principle" record.  
I can't say I had much interest after those two gems. To me he was more caricature than creative!

 It wasn't until 2013's "Splinter: Songs From A Broken Mind" that I bothered to listen again.

 His most recent recent release takes him to a whole new level. In all seriousness, I can't think of a better record than this all year. It's grim, it's brutal, it's relevant in it's dystopian overtones and it absolutely kicks arse!
