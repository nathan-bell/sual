### OK, it's quite corny in places but that only half describes this slightly easy/uneasy, but effortlessly listenable recording from Hawaii's premier ex-shoe shining, piano shop proprietor.

 While much of it runs like a marketing promo for attracting tourism, it's got some great and totally unexpected off kilter guitar-led, psych excursions.

 Discovered via a YouTude video blog, this digital download is nothing less than fully vinyl-worthy, if you can find it that is. I'd be very keen to hunt one this down.
