### This is another record from my newly acquired Aussie collection kindly gifted to me by my Wattle Glen friends from the Shire of Nillumbik (About 25 km North East of Melbourne).

 This is more of an anthemic, full blown rock album with a bit more edge and grunt than the Psych-tinged flavours I've been savouring lately. And it's really good.
