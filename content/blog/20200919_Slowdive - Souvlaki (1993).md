### A gorgeous mid-nineties dreamy shoegaze record of the highest order.    
  
For the unsuspecting, it can be an otherworldly swirl of guitar noise and way-down-in-the-mix vocals, but it's never short of a spine tingling melody within that dirge.   
  
I haven't heard this album for at least 20 years and finally picked it up on vinyl today.  It is goose bump inducingly good. So good in fact, I had to play it all over again later this evening.
