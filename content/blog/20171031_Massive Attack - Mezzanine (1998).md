### Just bought this big, 4-sided monster on vinyl. One of my "Desert Island Discs" without doubt, it is certainly way up there as one of the greatest and most pioneering works ever created.

 It's impact on many music genre's is phenomenal. Aside from it's sonic brilliance, it just oozes "COOL". In my opinion, the first four tracks cannot be bettered by any other recording on the planet. The other seven tracks are merely astounding by comparison.

 You want bottom end - stick this baby on your turntable. One of the most vinyl-worthy records in my collection.
