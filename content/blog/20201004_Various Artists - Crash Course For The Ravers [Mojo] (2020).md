 Another fun-and-fan-filled and somewhat obscure Bowie-related compilation - this time courtesy of Mojo Magazine.  (Uncut Magazine released a couple of Bowie cover compilations back in 2003 and 2008).   
  
This feels like the lost compilation that completes a trilogy of brilliant tributes to the great man.   
  
The cover also happens to be my favourite Bowie picture of all time courtesy of the late Brian Duffy.
