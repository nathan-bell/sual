### There's just no "in between" with this guy - you either love him or loath him and most people will judge him based on his public persona. OK, he certainly doesn't help himself.

 However, when it comes to his artistry, I will always outwardly defend his incredible music. I still rate his 2010 album "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" as the best record that I have heard this century. 

 This record from 2013 is another astounding record. While it's completely different musically from MBDTF, it's similarly confounding and innovative. There's simply no template for this one.
