### I finally picked a vinyl copy of this mid-90's trip hop (whatever?) classic today.   
  
If ever there was a record that was vinyl-worthy - it's this one.   
This record is just so good, I'm not even going to attempt to describe it.    
  
Incidentally, three of the last 5 of albums I've listened to are from this period and coincidently the Smashing Pumpkins are sampled and referenced on the track "Pumpkin".

If you like being a complete music nerd, it's an ideal way to get your fix.
