### I'm really not sure about this. Low going all electronic noize with hyper-processed/distorted vocals just hasn't got me feeling the love.

 I usually love this stuff but Low doing Eraserhead just isn't right. There are some joyous/harmonious Low moments but these are scarce. 

 While it's got all of the accolades from the music press I'm giving it a miss.

 Thursday's difficult record, "Swans - Seer", was like listening to Danny Kaye in comparison to this.
