### This cracker of a live session was captured on primitive recording equipment solely for the purposes of garnering interest for potential employment around the local clubs of Athens, Georgia.

 It was never really intended for wider distribution but finds itself as one of the 4 slabs of vinyl that make up the wonderful "Pylon Box".

 While Pylon only lasted a few years, the two records they did produce during that time are just fantastic. Venessa Briscoe Hay, the vitriolic front woman is truly remarkable.

 This box is one of my most prized possessions.
