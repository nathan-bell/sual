### Co-written with Reeves Gabrels, this is Bowie’s most mellow record since “Hunky Dory”. It still rocks out in places though, especially with Mr. Gabrels shredding out. 

 Pretty much panned by the critics, it’s another “lost” 90s record for me. I’ve learnt in this world one of the most important lessons, and one that is especially true of music, is to make up your own mind. Its not cool to dislike something because its not cool.

 Like the last few Bowie records I’ve listened to, this a a big miss. If anyone deserves a full and ongoing appreciation, it's Mr. Bowie.
