### Following the final lancing of punk’s great big oozing boil, there emerged some of my favourite bands and musicians. This was in 1978 and through the early to mid eighties. Nothing that followed, that I became interested in anyway, followed the usual dinosaur rock formula I was once a bit too comfortable with.

 It was the most music-genre-bending time of my life. Echo And The Bunnymen, The Only Ones, Joy Division/New Order , The Fall, Cabaret Voltaire and the fucking brilliant Magazine were just some of my new musical mentors.

 This compilation is a "best of" Magazine collection and includes some incredible tunes delivered with astounding vitriol and temporal lobe obliterating intensity.  
  
The scarily talented Howard Devoto, John McGeoch, Dave Formula and Barry Adamson were Magazine.

 “Secondhand Daylight” their 1979 release is also on my list of 10 most influential records.
