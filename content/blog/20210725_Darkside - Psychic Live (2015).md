### Insanely good live performance of Darkside's brilliant 2013 album "Psychic", a mind warping, non-genre specific monster of a record.

 Watching this reminds me of the time that I walked into one my all time, smily face moments of pure musical bliss - Unkle playing live in the "Boiler Room" at The Big Day Out.

 Pure electronic/guitar driven heaven.
