### I'm not a proud man. How could I resist this 2016, 40th Anniversary Legacy vinyl picture disc for just $22!   
  
I've never really bought into the whole picture disc thing but in this case it convinced me enough to buy this record. If the music is complete shit, at least I've got some funky artwork to hang on my wall.  
  
Anyway, no such luck, it's a great record (even if a wee bit dated) and having "More Than A Feeling" on vinyl is worth it for the price alone.
