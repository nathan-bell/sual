### I've had a bit of a revelation today after a great Shut Up And Listen Session the evening before.   
Streaming stuff instead of relying on physical media is perfectly OK. One doesn't always need a big chunk of vinyl or small plastic disc to enjoy music.

 I was going to buy this record on vinyl but now ask myself "why" when it just sounds brilliant streaming for free, [ok, technically a fraction of the cost] from Tidal. Don't get me wrong, I love my vinyl adventures, but I really can't always justify that added expense and inconvenience.

 This album by duo Darkside, is crazy good and demands several listens to unfold. The duo also contains one Nicolas Jaar who's record I played a couple of days ago. It all makes complete sense.
