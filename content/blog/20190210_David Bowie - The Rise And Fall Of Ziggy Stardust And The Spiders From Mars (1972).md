### For me THE high water mark of Bowie's whole career. 

 The whole album is basically all reflex in my brain. I know every note, every nuance, every lyric. 

 It wasn't the first Bowie record I heard, that was Aladdin Sane, but it was and is the best Bowie record I ever heard.

 This 2003 remix thankfully doesn't mess with anything - it  just allows the instruments some more breathing space. Those segues into each song are beyond perfect. Messing with those is like painting a frown on the Mona Lisa!
