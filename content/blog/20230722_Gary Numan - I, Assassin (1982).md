### Gazza was absolutely persecuted, nay despised by the music press and completely ignored by the radio jocks after his early fame.

 It took him another 20 years to get any recognition and to gain his confidence back. A couple of stonkingly good releases certainly helped him.

 This record is worth owning for Pino Palladino's bass playing alone. 

 His syrupy hooks on "Music For Chameleons" is the soundtrack to Alan Partridge's air bass guitar playing in one of his hilarious season two episodes. Back of the net!
