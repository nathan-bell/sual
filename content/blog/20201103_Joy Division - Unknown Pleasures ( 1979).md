### I was completely absorbed and inspired to play this following a recent bus commute from Richmond to Nelson.

 (if I'm honest, the bleakness of this record is warmly welcomed after another day working in that dreadful town they call Richmond!)

 One of my greatest pleasures when I've got nothing better to do, is to listen to a decent podcast. 

 "Transmissions: The Definitive Story of Joy Division & New Order" is a FANTASTIC podcast/documentary about these two legendary bands.

 As for the music. This debut by Joy Division is beyond classification and comparison. Never less than stunning!
