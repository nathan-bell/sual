### It's been a fucking ridiculous week! A quick trip to Hastings, a week ago today, where I sat with my father overnight and through part of the next day when he finally lost his battle with life. 

 His funeral, on the Thursday, was on the same day my wife Sarah back in Nelson sat with her own mother as she took her last breath. 

 Today, my new Grandson entered the world. Fuck me, a lot can happen in just 7 days!

 My father liked Elton John. We played the song "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" as he left St. Matthews church in his coffin.

 It's only apt that I play one of my favorite Elton albums today. 

 I bought this on vinyl on my return to Nelson as a tangeble symbol to celebrate Dad's life. 

 The packaging alone stirring memories of family life and my early years of musical escapism. RIP Dad!
