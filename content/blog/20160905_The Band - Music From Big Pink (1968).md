### This is not something I ever listened to in the past. Afterall, I was just a nipper when this came out. I bought it, rather cheaply on vinyl, thinking I must get around to listening to this.

 Aside from the track "The Weight", this is actually my first complete listen. Now pick yourself off the floor - it's true.Â While it might be a crime to have missed this, I'm really enjoying the catch up. A record that definitely lives up to the hype.

 Sounding brilliant on heavy vinyl.
