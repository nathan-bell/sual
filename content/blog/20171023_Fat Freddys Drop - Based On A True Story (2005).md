### I first heard the track "Ernie" at our last "Shut Up And Listen" session back in September and was suitably impressed enough to buy the vinyl.

 Recorded at "The Drop" at Lyall Bay nearly 12 years ago it's certainly a great re-discovery. (Thanks Chris)

 The bottom end coming from those speakers is insane! Giving it so much space, just 2 or 3 tracks each over 4 sides, lets this baby breathe.  
   
Another big, funky Wellington slab of happiness!.
