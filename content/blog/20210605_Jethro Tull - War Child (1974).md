### This is a Tull record that was never "in the circle" of their great predecessors - namely "Aqualung", "Thick As A Brick" and "A Passion Play", and I missed it completely.

 I picked up the 2CD/2DVD 40th Anniversary Edition from The Warehouse 4 or 5 years ago for some ridiculous price and am playing it for the first time. And loving it!

 These Deluxe Anniversary Editions from Chrysalis are superb and now fetching up to $300 each.
