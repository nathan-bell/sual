### This album, their fourth, may have been my very first exposure to the Stereolab collective back in the late 90's.    
  
Many a CD was thrust into my mitts, including this one, as I ventured into Everyman Records. It was very much a try-before-you-buy situation.  Iâ€™m not sure if Nathan was behind the counter back then but I befriended many of the staff over the years.   
  
I also had an "arrangement" where I did some of their IT/Database work and was paid in CDs. It was fucking brilliant! (I also got free milk for work I did for our milk man - bugger me, it's all coming back now -  I might need counselling!)    
  
Six albums in, and I'm loving every minute.
