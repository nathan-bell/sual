### Today we journey back to the introspective (read melodramatic!), syrupy, hit-oriented 60's where production was far more important than the song.

This compilation trawls through some pretty obscure and, at times, cringe-worthy songs that Lee Hazlewood either produced or wrote for other artists.

A great throw-away soundtrack to everyday life (or not!) with gems like "The Girl On Death Row" and "My Baby Plays The Same Old Song On His Guitar All Night Long".
