### Wow! This ain’t rock’n’roll, this is an electro-cabaret masterpiece. Tricky prodigy Alison Goldfrapp, croons like Liza Minelli, yodels like Melanie Oesch, and whistles like Roger Whitaker. 

 Will Gregory conducts the orchestra like some mad theremin player and at times, while processing the singer’s voice, sounds like one as well. Nothing will prepare you for this magnificent record.
