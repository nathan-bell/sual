### This is another vinyl relic that's been added to my "Essentials" vinyl collection. This 2019 re-press is NOT the Steven Wilson remaster but the original 1980 pressing.

 ([That's what the Blu-ray, high resolution, everything-including-the-kitchen-sink releases are for](http://www.shutupandlisten.co.nz/what-im-listening-too/2020/1/7/xtc-black-sea-2017-steven-wilson-mix-1980))

 This is just pure pop perfection that sounds as unique and fresh as when I first heard it. 

*There is no language in our lungs*

*There is no muscle in our tongues*

*To tell the world what's in our hearts*

 No further comment necessary.
