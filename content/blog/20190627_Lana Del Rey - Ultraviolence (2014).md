### I'm surprised Lana Del Rey has never performed at the Roadhouse in Twin Peaks. She's just made for such a venue.

 (checkout the recent and final series - it's a complete mind fuck with some fantastic musical interludes thrown in the mix)

 Lana Del Rey loves David Lynch, and it's well known that he loves her back.

 *“Lana Del Rey, she’s got some fantastic charisma and — this is a very interesting thing — it’s like she’s born out of another time,”* Lynch said. 

 *“She’s got something that’s very appealing to people. And I didn’t know that she was influenced by me!”*

 Come on, she's Bob's bastard child!
