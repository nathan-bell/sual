### Every so often I catch the bus (reluctantly) to Richmond. (This endlessly sprawling and souless "location" where I just happen to work, would never be on any of my "favourite-places-to-be" list. I'm just saying!)  
  
Anyhow's, it's a great opportunity to catch up with some great podcasts on the 30 minute commute. On a recent sojourn I listened to a great "Mixtape" session courtesy of Radio NZ. It featured Sandy Mill a well accomplished session singer who has worked with Neil Finn, SJD and Placebo amongst many others. One of her choices was Jane Weaver and the track "Modern Kosmology"  
  
The track completely floored me and with the immediacy of a brilliant streaming service, I had the album on my phone within minutes. I'll listen to it a few times before I pass judgement but on first full listen it's going to get plenty of airtime.
