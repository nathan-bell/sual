### This album has been popping up on a few underrated records rants and references lately so I thought I better check it out.    
  
I stopped listening to Elton John after 1975's "Rock Of The Westies" (his rockiest record by far) so gave up on anything following this.   
  
Listening cold on my big B&W headphones cabled to my iPhone via a hi-res Tidal download, this is quite the revelation.  If you dislike Elton, this isn't going to suddenly turn you around, but on first listen it's a record that will reward greatly on further exposure.   
  
This record was also quite a significant album historically as it was also Bernie Taupin's last, for a good while anyway. Things went decidedly downhill since then.
