### This is guitar heaven for alt-rock/dirgey guitar slinger freaks. J. Mascis, as on this album, remains a true shred maestro with his trusty '63 Fender Jazzmaster amped up to the hilt.

 Actually, I did see him playing an "acoustic" solo set as an opening act for Sonic Youth in the 90's. What I thought was going to be an acoustic, unplugged set turned out to be some of the raunchiest, squealiest, and loudest guitar playing I've ever heard.

 Three songs in - he hit's a foot pedal - a wah wah-heavy, bliss blizzard prevails for the next 45 minutes!!

 I'm loving ["A Sonic Youth" podcast](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/a-sonic-youth-oliver-grey-3RfVvdTNcsl/) - this fairly recent release is just another magic discovery revered by 20 year old Kiwi, Oliver Grey.
