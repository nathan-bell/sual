### You may be thinking "it's 2019 and this Geezer is still play fucking Supertramp". While not everyone's cup-of-very-British-tea, this particular record is a significant bit of ear candy for me.

 Anyhow, that's not the reason I'm playing it.

 I've been listening to the brilliant "The Blindboy Podcast" lately and one of two recommended records to listen to (as homework) was this record and The Kinks "The Village Green Preservation Society".

 So really, I'm only following instructions. All those Supertramp haters can fuck off!!
