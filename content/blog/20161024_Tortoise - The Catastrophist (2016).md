### Don't let the cover put you off! It's pretty hideous but I suppose it does lend itself to the awkwardness of some of the music. I'm not immediately comfortable with this.

 Geeky, math rock in places, it's closer to jazz than rock but don't try and coat it with any genre - it's far from straight forward. 

 I'm not sure what to make of it on my first listen but there is enough to justify spending more time with it.
