### My mind is mush, any thoughts of being productive went out the window a week ago, it's survival mode only.

 Another work do (which was great), good wishes to all and it's now time to let go completely.

 What better way to unwind than the magnificence of Kevin Rowland's Dexys. 

 This is more pantomime-come-stage show than rock'n'roll but with songs and passion this great who's complaining.

 Kevin Rowland is quite simply an unstable genius of the highest order.
