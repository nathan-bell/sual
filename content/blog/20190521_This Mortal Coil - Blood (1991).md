### What a completely bonkers show "[Now Apocalypse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8201814/?ref_=nv_sr_2?ref_=nv_sr_2)" is.  I've no hope of ever explaining what it's about but just to say there's some great incidental music happening throughout.

 Yesterday I heard "Sugar Hiccup" by the fabulous Cocteau Twins during a club scene. The Cocteauâ€™s were 4AD label mates of this collective brought together for a third and final "This Mortal Coil" recording. 

 While it's a fabulous and ageless record over it's entirety, Kim Deal and Tanya Donelly are especially sensational with their reinterpretation of Big Star's "You And Your Sister".
