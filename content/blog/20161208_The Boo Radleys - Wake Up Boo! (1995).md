### Loved the Boos from their first proper record, 1992's "Everything's Alright Forever". That was a rowdy, and somewhat murky affair (just post MBV's "Loveless") but definitely hinted of great things to come.

 This is them at their most melodic and poppy and sounding remarkably Beatlesque in places. There's lots of great studio effects and knob twiddling but it never seems gimmicky.

 Bought the 3CD remaster at "Sister Ray Records" in London for just two quid!
