### This album is the 4th in the Nancy Sinatra Archival Series on "Light in the Attic" records.

 Beautifully packaged and remastered, they look and sound fantastic.

 Nancy and Lee reunited for this 4 years after their more famous "Nancy & Lee" recording from 1968.

 While it doesn't come close to reaching the heights of their previous collaboration, it's still an underappreciated gem.
