### **Live: Saturday 19th July, 2003 - Town Hall, Auckland**

 Tagged onto the end of a work-related stay in Auckland, this gig was a great way to see out the week.

 The powerhouse three piece (with well hidden 2nd guitarist hanging back of stage) played a technically flawless set from their most recent album "Sleeping With Ghosts".

 Disappointingly, they didn't do any songs from their first album (my favorite) but did play a blinding version of "Without You I'm Nothing" (that song still gives me goosebumps!) and a fantastic cover of Pixie's "Where Is My Mind"

 Not up there with the best gigs but I'm still very grateful to have seen them close to their prime.
