### Fabulous debut record from South London's Dry Cleaning.

 It's the first time heard tonight, on recommendation from Mr. Smithies. It's an immediate slam dunk.

 Very much in the vein of Black Box Recorder and perhaps a less abrasive The Fall, lead lady, Florence Shaw, literally talks (tautology alert) over the band.

 And what a stunning band it is! Spoken word, guitar shred heaven.
