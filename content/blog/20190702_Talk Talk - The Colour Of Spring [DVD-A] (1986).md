### One of my all time favorites, this record just oozes class.

 Buying this on vinyl was a no-brainer. Getting a free copy of this astounding album on hi-res DVD-A along with the vinyl copy was the icing on top.

 I've got a pile of new vinyl to listen to after my field day at "The Family Jewels". It's a testament to my passion about this record that this takes complete precedence over everything.
