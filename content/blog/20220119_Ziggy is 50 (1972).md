### I heard "Starman" and "Suffragette City" on the car radio this morning. The realisation soon hit me - Ziggy is 50 years old!!

 While there's nothing much more I could say that hasn't been said about this remarkable record, there aren't (m)any records that have aged as well as this.

 Just imagine if Bowie fell to Earth during these times. He'd get in his space ship and fuck off.   
  
We wouldnâ€™t have deserved him.
