### My first ever encounter with Midlake was this, their second record. OK, I'm not a proud man but America's "Homecoming", which is way up near the top of my "guilty pleasures" list, springs to mind.

 This definitely dips it's toe in the America/Bread/Fleetwood Mac (early 70's) sound. And it's captivating.
