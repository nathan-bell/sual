### What a fantastic way to start the weekend!   
It’s sunny, I don’t have to go to work, and I have time to relax without any demands. (Her indoors is outdoors running with the dog).    
  
I put the heavy, orange slab of vinyl on the turntable, sit in my favourite listening spot and I am instantly tele-ported to my very happy place.    
  
This FANTASTIC compilation, a sort-of homage to Twin Peaks the TV series and the music you could hear as a soundtrack, is just chock full of brilliant unknown songs from known and unknown artists.     
  
It’s life affirming and exhilarating and my first wow moment of the year.
