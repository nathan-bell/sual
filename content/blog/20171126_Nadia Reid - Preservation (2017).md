### I was completely wowed by Nadia Reid's first record, "Listen to Formation Look for the Signs". It was right up there with my favourite records of 2015. Listening to her second effort "Preservation" via Tidal and through headphones left me wanting. I gave it away completely.

 Recently, I came across the CD nested among an eclectic bunch of mainly NZ albums at Craig Potton's studio and it said "buy me!". So I did. And boy am I glad I did.

 Given the proper breathing space and an unfettered listening experience it is a thing of great beauty.

 Along with Aldous Harding, Nadia Reid is another immense talent flying slightly under the radar.

 Best track: Te Aro
