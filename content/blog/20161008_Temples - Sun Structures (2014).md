### Brilliant debut from 4 Kettering lads. Along with Tame Impala, who springs to mind immediately, these neo-retro specialists are stuck in a mid to late 60's time warp.

 Even though all the tracks sparkle equally amidst the dirge, "Move With The Season" and the following "Colours To Life" are especially captivating. Maybe it's a sign that Summer definitely on it's way. 

 This version, which I picked up at HMV in London has a bonus disc of "restructured" versions. I'm keen not to overdose on too much of a good thing but something to look forward to  perhaps.
