### SRV's first and best record.   
  
Boosted by a guest slot on Bowie's "Lets Dance" and a free recording ticket courtesy of Jackson Browne, this debut just oozes raw talent and authentic blues.

 Right up there with Rory Gallagher and Jonny Winter, this is further proof that white men most certainly can play the blues. At least a few of them anyway.
