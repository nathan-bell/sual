 It's been full-on 12 hour plus days over a 13 day solid stretch as I rolled up my sleeves and gave all the techy stuff a kick up the pants. All in support of this Covid-19 nasty!!   
  
We live at a time unlike any other where the health of our nation takes precedent over the dog-eat-dog world of capitalism and money grabbing corporations. Economy at all costs must give way to saving lives. A National government might have done this very differently. Thank fuck for our great leader and the right party in the right place at the right time.   
  
This is a stunning and timeless reminder of the greatness of music and raising a finger to the reptiles!
