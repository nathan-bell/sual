### I’ve listened to Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac, up to and including the excellent “Then Play On” and the megastar Linsey Buckingham-era Fleetwood Mac that peaked with “Rumours” and “Tusk”.  
  
This is completely new territory for me and a transitional Mac period that I completely overlooked. I must say, I’m more than a little bit pleasantly surprised.

 I know a bit of the back story about Danny Kirwan’s personal troubles and ultimate departure from the band but you sense from this record he had a huge influence on the band’s musical direction.  
  
I picked up this and “Bare Trees” on vinyl from the big red shed. Both in the bargain bin.
