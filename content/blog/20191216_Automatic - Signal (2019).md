### Released just a few months ago, this debut record by LA trio "Automatic", is possibly my find of the year.   
  
On non-stop rotation for the last couple of days it's wormed it's way into my brain.   
It has a early 80's new wave, electronic vibe not disimilar to a joyful Joy Division, early New Order and Wire.  
  
On further investigation the drummer is daughter of Kevin Haskins, ex drummer for Bauhaus, Tones On Tail and Love and Rockets. That really explains a lot!
