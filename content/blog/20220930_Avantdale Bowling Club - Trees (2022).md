### I had my first listen to this hot-off-the-press album {OK, I streamed and downloaded it from off-shore servers somewhere in the ethers} from Taite Music Prize-winning hip hop / jazz project Avantdale Bowling Club.

 This was on a delayed return flight from Napier to Wellington. This was via a Tidal download to my iPhone and listening through my Sony WH-1000XM4 noise-cancelling, wireless headphones. If that’s not full engagement I don’t know what is? No water, no lollies, just uninterrupted bliss!

 All I can really say is this is one of the most rewarding first listens I’ve ever encountered. Whatever the format, it will be on high rotation.
