### Wow! This is one of the most stunning sounding records I've heard in a long time. Not just production-wise, it's a musical masterpeice. 

 (I'd never hesitate in picking up a "Music On Vinyl" pressing - they are consistently great.) 

 I picked this up in a "The Warehouse" sale (for a pittace no doubt) a number of years ago and have had it tucked away for a rainy day.

 It's wet outside.
