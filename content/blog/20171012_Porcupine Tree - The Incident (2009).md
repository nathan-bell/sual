### I had a browse through the latest "Prog" magazine today and felt mildly embarrassed with the imagery and pseudo-seriousness that pervaded through each page turn. 

 Aside from the mighty Opeth who featured in this edition, I now find it hard to take this genre seriously. Porcupine Tree and Steven Wilson, while inherently in the progressive rock genre, are really a category unto themselves.

 I am never less than totally absorbed by any PT or SW record I ever play. This record is no exception. The man's a genius!
