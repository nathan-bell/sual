### Had a bit of a false start with this one.

 Cable connection issues this evening from my turntable to my amplifier. I really thought the Yo's were being oh-so-clever just coming out of the right channel.

 A quick CD test put paid to that.

 A bit of faffing around and it was sorted. To be honest, vinyl/turntable management can be a fickle/fiddly business.

 Once the planets all aligned - the rich, warm, organic sounds of the Yo's filled the room. Phew, I nearly conceded defeat!
