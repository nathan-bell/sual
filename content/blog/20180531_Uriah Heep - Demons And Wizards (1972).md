### This record, along with their earlier "Very 'Eavy Very 'Umble", Tull's "Aqualung" and the incomparable and never bettered, The Who's "Live At Leeds" were HUGE for me as a shy, day dreaming, on-another-planet 12 year old.

 As I've mentioned many times, I can thank my older stoner sister for bringing all of these treasures into our house.  
  
Uriah Heep were a bit special though - they had a fucking big Hammond organ!!. This was the antithesis of my mother's organ playing at St. James Anglican church. (I was obviously an early adopter of atheism?)  
  
This is such a great album throughout and brings back some real magic. Listening to the guitar solo in "The Spell" is giving me Goosebumps!!

 Just for the record, I just had to play "Gypsy" from "Very 'Eavy Very 'Umble". What a bit mother fucker of a riff.
