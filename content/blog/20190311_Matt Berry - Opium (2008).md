### Most people just wouldn't get this and I wouldn't want them to. Matt Berry, who is due to be one of the stars of the new "What We Do In The Shadows" TV series, is a acting, comedy and musical genius.

 I should warn you, it’s a totally ludicrous experience! 

 If you like "Toast Of London" or the truly surreal Matt Berry moments of "The IT Crowd" you will love it. There’s simply no hope, if you don’t.
