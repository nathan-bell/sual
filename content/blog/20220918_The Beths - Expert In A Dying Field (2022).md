### Full of catchy riffage and pop-leaning hooks, this new release from The Beths should be great to see played live next week.

 While I'm not a full on Beths fan, I think it's time to get out and support touring bands at every opportunity. They play at Nelson's Theatre Royal on Saturday 24th.

 So far, I'm liking what I hear. There's some tasty tunes and stellar guitar playing throughout.

 On the last track there's even a tilt of the hat to Sonic Youth's discordant tunings and chaos.
