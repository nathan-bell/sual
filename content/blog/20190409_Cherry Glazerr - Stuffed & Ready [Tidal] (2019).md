### My favourite record so far this year would have to be this noisy little gem from Clementine Creevyâ€™s LA collective. 

 10 tracks of pure, mid-90s grungy angst. Lots of dirty detuned guitars, off-kilter screechy lady vocals and in your face, melodic glory.  At just over 30 minutes it remains on very high rotation
