### My second and only other RSD purchase  was this little gem from Dunedin's, now long-defunct, Cloudboy. 

 While I didn't know anything about this record, or the musicians involved,  it was a record they were running out of around the country very quickly. 

 FOMO took hold of me and I gave in to a hype-induced fleecing.

 However, on first listen, I must say it's a wonderfully weird, ethereal mess of a record. The type of outlier I tend to gravitate towards.
