### 5.1 Surround DVD Audio

 Having just returned from my overseas excursion to the UK, I'll be focusing this month on stuff I bought home (and there's a shit load!!)

 First up is drumming heavy weight Gavin Harrison. He has re-visited his old band's back catalogue and produced an epic, big band re-interpretation of Porcupine Tree songs.  
It's a huge room filling production that showcases some impressive arrangement skills. Sounding huge in spectacular surround sound.
