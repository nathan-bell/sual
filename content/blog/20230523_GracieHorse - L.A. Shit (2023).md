### Sometimes country music can be right up on top of my "this-genre-ain't-for-me" list, along with some god awful Jazz.

 While this is most definitely a country album, it doesn't even come close to making that list.

 Gracie Jackson is GracieHorse and along with her band of dual banjo pickers and guitar slingers, delivers a real treat.
